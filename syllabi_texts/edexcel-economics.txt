Why choose Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in 
Economics? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the international subject community. We have 
made changes that will engage students and provide opportunities for them to gain skills 
that will support progression to further study of economics, and to enhance future 
educational or employment prospects. 
The content and assessment approach for this qualification has been designed to meet 
students’ needs in the following ways. 
Two-paper assessment – a new, two-paper model gives students better opportunities to 
prepare for and focus on different aspects of economics. We will test knowledge, 
understanding, analytical and evaluation skills around two themes: Paper 1: Microeconomics 
and Business Economics and Paper 2: Macroeconomics and the Global Economy. 
Concepts and content – the content in both Paper 1: Microeconomics and Business 
Economics and Paper 2: Macroeconomics and the Global Economy is engaging and accessible 
for all students. The content is appropriate and relevant for progression, and is appropriate 
for international students, building understanding and awareness of economic theory and 
testing concepts in realistic contexts. It develops students’ ability to participate effectively in 
global society as citizens, producers and consumers.  
Clear and straightforward question papers – our question papers are clear and 
accessible for students of all ability ranges. Our mark schemes are straightforward so that 
the assessment requirements are clear. 
Broad and deep development of skills – the design of the revised International GCSE 
aims to extend students’ knowledge by broadening and deepening skills, for example 
students will develop the ability to: 
• read sources to interpret and evaluate economic information 
• write extended responses 
• respond appropriately to a range of question types, including multiple-choice,  
short-answer, data response and open-ended questions 
• develop an understanding of economic concepts and apply these concepts to real-life 
situations. 
Progression to A Level – International GCSEs enable successful progression to Level 3 
qualifications (such as the International A Level in Economics) and beyond, in economics and 
other subjects. Through our world class qualification development process, we have 
consulted international economics teaching experts to validate this qualification, and endorse 
its content, skills development and assessment structure.

Paper 1: Microeconomics and Business Economics 
Externally assessed 
Description 
 
 
You will start by learning about basic economic problems. All 
resources are scarce and therefore limited in supply. Consumers, 
firms and governments all have to make choices between different 
products and these choices will introduce you to the concept of 
opportunity cost. 
Microeconomics is the study of individual markets. You will learn 
about the supply and demand model, which will give you a toolkit 
to explore how changes in the economy will affect supply, 
demand, price and quantity. The model will help to explain why 
prices rise and fall, for example enabling you to explain the 
changes in oil, house, gold and cocoa prices. You will look at how 
much the quantity supplied and demanded will respond to changes 
in price or income, which will help you to understand why some 
price changes see large or small changes in quantity. 
Having looked at how markets work, you will look at how they 
sometimes fail. In some cases we overconsume as we ignore 
negative impacts on others, for example pollution. In other cases 
we underconsume as we might undervalue the benefits our 
education could bring to others. 
You will then move on to studying business economics. You will 
look at what is needed to produce goods and services, including 
land, labour, capital and enterprise. You will look at how 
businesses can organise production to improve the output per 
worker, which we call productivity. You will study business costs, 
revenues and profits. You will then explore different types of 
businesses, from those that are competitive to single firms that we 
call monopolies, and also those industries with several large firms, 
which we call oligopolies. In each case you will consider the 
advantages of the types of business that exist. 
Sometimes markets and businesses do not give the best outcome 
for people and so governments have to enter the market. You will 
look at the alternative ways in which they can affect markets, 
considering the benefits and drawbacks of each.

Assessment information 
 
 
Examination of 1 hour and 30 minutes, set and marked by 
Pearson. 
Single tier of entry. 
The total number of marks available is 80. 
The examination paper consists of four compulsory questions, 
each worth 20 marks. The questions are a mixture of multiple-
choice, short-answer, data response and open-ended questions. 
Each question will be based on a particular topic from the subject 
content related to microeconomics and business economics. Due 
to the nature of economics, there is some interrelation between 
topics.

Paper 2: Macroeconomics and the Global Economy 
Externally assessed 
Description 
 
 
In macroeconomics you will look at all the markets combined in a 
country. So you will now look at your own countries’ and other 
countries’ economies. You will look at the different objectives that 
governments will be concerned about. These include trying to 
achieve: 
• low inflation 
• low unemployment 
• increases in economic growth 
• surpluses or equilibrium on the current account of the balance 
of payments 
• redistribution of income 
• environmental protection. 
For each objective, you will look at the issues and problems 
involved and how the government acts to improve the outcomes. 
You will then look at the global economy. This will involve looking 
at the benefits and problems of increased integration between 
economies of the globe. You will look at international trade and 
how countries come together as trading partners to boost growth. 
Exchange rates will also be looked at to consider how changes can 
affect an economy. You will study both developing and developed 
economies.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is available on our website. 
Students should be advised that if they take two qualifications in the same subject, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved only one 
of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers who have any doubts 
about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to progress 
before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be in 
English. 
We recommend that students are able to read and write in English at level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
• access the assessment 
• show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• the needs of the student with the disability 
• the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• the cost of the adjustment; and 
• the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an 
assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. 
Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as possible. Note that the 
final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on 
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). 
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ General and vocational qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale 
from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual 
components are not graded. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Economics will be in 2019. Students whose level of achievement is 
below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be recorded on a 
certificate will receive an unclassified U result.

Appendix 4: Pearson World Class Qualification 
design principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational  
thought-leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that 
Edexcel qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in 
qualification and assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner 
progression in today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-Class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
“I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and

in the 21st century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that 
sort of education.” Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process 
May 2014 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included, where appropriate: 
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidenced process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 5: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in Economics and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full subject 
interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for student development is 
given on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com

Appendix 6: Glossary 
 
Term 
Definition 
Assessment 
objectives 
The requirements that students need to meet to succeed in the 
qualification. Each assessment objective has a unique focus which 
is then targeted in examinations or coursework/non-examined 
assessment. Assessment objectives may be assessed individually or 
in combination. 
External 
assessment 
An examination that is held at the same time and place in a global 
region. 
JCQ 
Joint Council for Qualifications. This is a group of UK exam boards 
who develop policy related to the administration of examinations. 
Linear 
Qualifications that are linear have all assessments at the end of a 
course of study. It is not possible to take one assessment earlier in 
the course of study. 
Raw marks 
Raw marks are the actual marks that students achieve when taking 
an assessment. When calculating an overall grade raw marks often 
need to be converted so that it is possible to see the proportionate 
achievement of a student across all units of study.
