4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is also available on our website. 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCSE/International GCSE qualifications. Students or their advisers who 
have any doubts about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they 
wish to progress before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be in 
English. 
We recommend that students are able to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Issue 4 – March 2022 © Pearson Education Limited 2022

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
• access the assessment 
• show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• the needs of the student with the disability 
• the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• the cost of the adjustment 
• the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a candidate's mark or grade to reflect 
temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/assessment which 
has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability to take an 
assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment, or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered before the candidate has signed 
the declaration of authentication form does not need to be reported to Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after the declaration of authenticity 
has been signed, and in examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The completed form should be 
emailed to candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and 
supporting documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment, or undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a JCQ 
Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). 
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
Suspected Malpractice Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice.

Appendix 2: Pearson World Class Qualification 
design principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Pearson Edexcel 
qualifications are developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational 
thought leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure 
that Pearson Edexcel qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class 
best practice in qualification and assessment design, maintain a consistent 
standard and support learner progression in today’s fast-changing world.  
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-Class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael 
Barber, a leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a 
wide range of key influencers with expertise in education and employability.  
“I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and 
assessment to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able 
to do in the 21st century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity 
to access that sort of education.” Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process  
May 2014 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included, where appropriate:  
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented, and that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. 
This is a structured, evidence-based process, which means that learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education, but as a result of our work as a panel we are 
confident that we have supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE 
qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to 
detail, and can be regarded as representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work.  
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework[2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
The NRC framework is included alongside literacy and numeracy skills. 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure that they are appropriate for 
the subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students.  
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in the International GCSE in History specification, and indicates the interpretation of 
each skill. A full subject interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for 
student development is given on the subject pages of our website:
