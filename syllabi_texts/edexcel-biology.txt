Why choose Edexcel qualifications? 
Pearson – the world’s largest education company  
Edexcel academic qualifications are from Pearson, the UK’s largest awarding organisation. 
With over 3.4 million students studying our academic and vocational qualifications 
worldwide, we offer internationally recognised qualifications to schools, colleges and 
employers globally.  
Pearson is recognised as the world’s largest education company, allowing us to drive 
innovation and provide comprehensive support for Edexcel students to acquire the 
knowledge and skills they need for progression in study, work and life.  
A heritage you can trust 
The background to Pearson becoming the UK’s largest awarding organisation began in 1836, 
when a royal charter gave the University of London its first powers to conduct exams and 
confer degrees on its students. With over 150 years of international education experience, 
Edexcel qualifications have firm academic foundations, built on the traditions and rigour 
associated with Britain’s education system.

Why choose Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in 
Biology? 
We’ve listened to feedback from all parts of the International and UK school subject 
community, including a large number of teachers. We’ve made changes that will engage 
students and give them skills that will support progression to further study in biology and a 
range of other subjects, in biological sciences and elsewhere. Our content and assessment 
approach has been designed to meet students’ needs and be consistent with our approach 
across the sciences. 
At Pearson we offer separate science qualifications in Biology, Human Biology, Chemistry and 
Physics, as well as Double Award and Single Award Science qualifications – these have been 
designed to meet different students’ needs. The content and assessment approach in all our 
science qualifications has been designed to meet students’ needs in the following ways. 
• Content that is interesting and engaging for students but is also designed to ensure good 
preparation, both for those continuing to further study and for those wishing to work in a 
biology-related field. 
• There are opportunities to ‘localise’ the content to make it more relevant for students in 
their own country. 
• Question papers are clear and straightforward – our question papers are clear and 
accessible for all students of all ability ranges and learning styles. Our mark schemes are 
straightforward, so that the assessment requirements are clear. 
• Students’ skills are broadly developed – we have designed the International GCSE to 
extend students’ knowledge by broadening and deepening skills, for example: 
– 
developing students’ practical skills by including a number of practicals in the 
specification content. These can be supplemented with other suggested practicals.  
The skills developed will be assessed through questions in written examinations  
– 
improving students’ analytical and logic skills by applying understanding of scientific 
concepts and principles to a range of situations. This will include some examination 
questions that are more problem solving in style 
– 
addressing the need for mathematical skills to complement students’ biology skills  
by covering a range of mathematical areas. 
Progression to A Level – International GCSEs enable successful progression to A Level and 
beyond. Through our World Class Qualification development process we have consulted with 
International Advanced Level and GCE A Level teachers as well as higher education 
professors to validate the appropriateness of the qualification, including its content, skills 
development and assessment structure. 
Courses to suit your students’ needs and interests – teachers of biology have a choice 
of International GCSE courses to deliver, each giving different levels of depth to meet 
students’ needs. As well as the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Biology, students can 
also be taught our International GCSE in Science (Double Award) or our International GCSE 
in Science (Single Award). The latter two courses offer a reduced amount of content, but are 
assessed to the same standard. Progression routes for these courses may vary slightly from 
those for the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Biology.  
More information about all our qualifications can be found on our Edexcel International GCSE 
pages at qualifications.pearson.com

The nature and variety of living organisms 
The following sub-topics are covered in this section. 
(a) 
Characteristics of living organisms 
(b) 
Variety of living organisms 
 
(a) 
Characteristics of living organisms 
Students should: 
1.1 
understand how living organisms share the following characteristics: 
• 
they require nutrition 
• 
they respire 
• 
they excrete their waste 
• 
they respond to their surroundings 
• 
they move 
• 
they control their internal conditions 
• 
they reproduce 
• 
they grow and develop. 
 
(b) 
Variety of living organisms 
Students should: 
1.2 
describe the common features shown by eukaryotic organisms: plants, animals, fungi 
and protoctists 
 
Plants: these are multicellular organisms; their cells contain chloroplasts and are able 
to carry out photosynthesis; their cells have cellulose cell walls; they store 
carbohydrates as starch or sucrose. Examples include flowering plants, such as a 
cereal (for example, maize), and a herbaceous legume (for example, peas or beans). 
 
Animals: these are multicellular organisms; their cells do not contain chloroplasts and 
are not able to carry out photosynthesis; they have no cell walls; they usually have 
nervous co-ordination and are able to move from one place to another; they often 
store carbohydrate as glycogen. Examples include mammals (for example, humans) 
and insects (for example, housefly and mosquito). 
 
Fungi: these are organisms that are not able to carry out photosynthesis; their body 
is usually organised into a mycelium made from thread-like structures called hyphae, 
which contain many nuclei; some examples are single-celled; their cells have walls 
made of chitin; they feed by extracellular secretion of digestive enzymes onto food 
material and absorption of the organic products; this is known as saprotrophic 
nutrition; they may store carbohydrate as glycogen. Examples include Mucor, which 
has the typical fungal hyphal structure, and yeast, which is single-celled. 
 
Protoctists: these are microscopic single-celled organisms. Some, like  Amoeba, that 
live in pond water, have features like an animal cell, while others, like  Chlorella, have 
chloroplasts and are more like plants. A pathogenic example is Plasmodium, 
responsible for causing malaria.

Specification – Issue 3 – September 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
12
 
Students should: 
1.3 
describe the common features shown by prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria 
 
Bacteria: these are microscopic single-celled organisms; they have a cell wall, cell 
membrane, cytoplasm and plasmids; they lack a nucleus but contain a circular 
chromosome of DNA; some bacteria can carry out photosynthesis but most feed off 
other living or dead organisms. Examples include Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a  
rod-shaped bacterium used in the production of yoghurt from milk, and 
Pneumococcus, a spherical bacterium that acts as the pathogen causing pneumonia. 
1.4 
understand the term pathogen and know that pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, 
protoctists or viruses 
 
Viruses: these are not living organisms. They are small particles, smaller than 
bacteria; they are parasitic and can reproduce only inside living cells; they infect 
every type of living organism. They have a wide variety of shapes and sizes; they 
have no cellular structure but have a protein coat and contain one type of nucleic 
acid, either DNA or RNA. Examples include the tobacco mosaic virus that causes 
discolouring of the leaves of tobacco plants by preventing the formation of 
chloroplasts, the influenza virus that causes ‘flu’ and the HIV virus that causes AIDS.

Sample assessment materials 
Sample papers and mark schemes can be found in the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE 
in Biology Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document. 
Experimental skills 
The best way to develop experimental skills is to embed practical investigations in teaching 
or theory. The development of knowledge and experimental skills can then happen together, 
leading to secure acquisition of both knowledge and skills. 
Our practical investigations are embedded within 2: Biology content as specification points in 
italics. The skills developed through these and other practicals will be assessed through 
written examinations. 
In the assessment of experimental skills, students may be tested on their ability to: 
• solve problems set in a practical context 
• apply scientific knowledge and understanding in questions with a practical context 
• devise and plan investigations, using scientific knowledge and understanding when 
selecting appropriate techniques 
• demonstrate or describe appropriate experimental and investigative methods, including 
safe and skilful practical techniques 
• make observations and measurements with appropriate precision, record these 
methodically and present them in appropriate ways 
• identify independent, dependent and control variables 
• use scientific knowledge and understanding to analyse and interpret data to draw 
conclusions from experimental activities that are consistent with the evidence 
• communicate the findings from experimental activities, using appropriate technical 
language, relevant calculations and graphs 
• assess the reliability of an experimental activity 
• evaluate data and methods taking into account factors that affect accuracy and validity. 
Calculators 
Students will be expected to have access to a suitable electronic calculator for all 
examination papers. Calculators that allow for the retrieval of text or formulae or  
QWERTY keyboards will not be allowed for use in examinations.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International information manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is also available on our website. 
Students should be advised that if they take two qualifications in the same subject, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved only one 
of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers, who have any doubts 
about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to progress 
before embarking on their programmes. 
Students may take the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Biology alongside the Pearson 
Edexcel International GCSE in Human Biology. 
Forbidden combinations  
This qualification may not be taken alongside: 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Science (Double Award) (Linear) (4SD0) 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Biology (Modular) (4XBI1) 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Science (Double Award) (Modular) (4XSD1) 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our Equality Policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.  
We recommend that students are able to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
• access the assessment 
• show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• the needs of the student with the disability 
• the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• the cost of the adjustment 
• the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation or unreasonable timeframes or if it affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the  
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment 
in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk

Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment, or undermines the integrity of the qualifications or 
the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High 
Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment, or undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2 (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson,  
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale 
from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are 
not graded. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in 
Biology will be in June 2019. Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum 
judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an 
unclassified U result.

Appendix 2: Pearson World Class Qualification 
design principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational thought 
leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that Edexcel 
qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in qualification and 
assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner progression in 
today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
‘I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.’ Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process 
December 2015 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included, where appropriate: 
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidenced process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills  
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table on the next page sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that 
can be found in biology and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full subject 
interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for students’ development is 
provided on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com

Appendix 5: Command word taxonomy 
The following table lists the command words used in the external assessments. 
 
Command word  
Definition 
Add/Label 
Requires the addition or labelling of a stimulus material given 
in the question, for example labelling a diagram or adding 
units to a table. 
Calculate 
Obtain a numerical answer, showing relevant working.  
Comment on 
Requires the synthesis of a number of variables from 
data/information to form a judgement.  
Complete 
Requires the completion of a table/diagram. 
Deduce 
Draw/reach conclusion(s) from the information provided. 
Describe 
To give an account of something. Statements in the response 
need to be developed, as they are often linked but do not 
need to include a justification or reason. 
Determine 
The answer must have an element that is quantitative from 
the stimulus provided, or must show how the answer can be 
reached quantitatively. To gain maximum marks, there must 
be a quantitative element to the answer. 
Design 
Plan or invent a procedure from existing principles/ideas. 
Discuss 
• 
Identify the issue/situation/problem/argument that is 
being assessed within the question. 
• 
Explore all aspects of an 
issue/situation/problem/argument. 
• 
Investigate the issue/situation etc. by reasoning or 
argument. 
Draw 
Produce a diagram either using a ruler or freehand. 
Estimate 
Find an approximate value, number or quantity from a 
diagram/given data or through a calculation. 
Evaluate 
Review information (e.g. data, methods) then bring it 
together to form a conclusion, drawing on evidence including 
strengths, weaknesses, alternative actions, relevant data or 
information. Come to a supported judgement of a subject’s 
quality and relate it to its context. 
Explain 
An explanation requires a justification/exemplification of a 
point. The answer must contain some element of 
reasoning/justification – this can include mathematical 
explanations. 
Give/State/Name 
All of these command words are really synonyms. They 
generally all require recall of one or more pieces of 
information. 
Give a reason/reasons 
When a statement has been made and the requirement is 
only to give the reason(s) why. 
Identify 
Usually requires some key information to be selected from a 
given stimulus/resource.
