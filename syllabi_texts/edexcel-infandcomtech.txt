Why choose Edexcel International GCSE in 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT)? 
We’ve listened to feedback from all parts of the international school and UK independent 
school subject community, including a large number of teachers. We’ve made changes that 
will engage students and give them skills that will support progression to the further study of 
ICT, Computing and a range of other subjects. 
We believe ICT and Computer Science are unique and complementary subjects serving 
different purposes and meeting different student needs, and therefore we are offering both 
subjects as International GCSEs. We think that ICT develops important skills in students, 
such as data handling, which are transferable and useful for a wide range of jobs. In an 
increasingly digital world, we want to provide students with every opportunity to learn skills 
that will enable them to thrive. 
The content and assessment approach for this qualification has been designed to meet 
student needs in the following ways: 
Developing confident and competent ICT users – This qualification provides students 
with the opportunity of operating confidently in today’s digital world. It is a useful, practical 
qualification which will provide skills needed in further education and work. 
Providing students with relevant and transferable skills – Students will learn about 
topics ranging from digital devices and connectivity, safe and responsible practice, and 
understand the impact of internet on the way that organisations do business. They will be 
also be encouraged to practice using software applications effectively. A CBI and Pearson 
report on employability and skills in 2012 said that ‘ Many employers are also keen to see 
the government encouraging schools and colleges to strengthen technology skills amongst 
young people’ 
(http://www.cbi.org.uk/media/1514978/cbi_education_and_skills_survey_2012.pdf)  
A similar report in 2015 said that ‘..close to half of businesses.. report having IT skills 
problems in their current workforces.’ 
(http://news.cbi.org.uk/reports/educationandskillssurvey2015/educationandskillssurvey2015) 
Clear and straightforward question papers – Our question papers are clear and 
accessible for all students of all ability ranges and learning styles. Our mark schemes are 
straightforward, so that the assessment requirements are clear. 
Broad and deep development of students’ skills – The design of the revised 
International GCSE aims to extend students’ knowledge and understanding by broadening 
and deepening skills, for example students develop the ability to: 
• 
apply knowledge and understanding to produce Information and Communication 
Technology-based solutions 
• 
develop skills of analysis and evaluation, making reasoned judgements and presenting 
conclusions 
• 
reflect critically on their own and others’ use of Information and Communication 
Technology and to adopt safe, secure and responsible practice. 
Progression to A Level – International GCSEs enable successful progression onto A level and 
beyond. Through our world class qualification development process we have consulted with 
teachers as well university professors to validate the appropriateness of this qualification for 
progression, including its content, opportunities for skills development and assessment 
structure.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and it is also available on our website. 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers who have any 
doubts about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• 
students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• 
all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be 
in English. 
We recommend that students are able to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Specification – Issue 2 – May 2018 © Pearson Education Limited 2018

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
• 
access the assessment 
• 
show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• 
the needs of the student with the disability 
• 
the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• 
the cost of the adjustment; and 
• 
the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment 
in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please go to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) website: 
www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High 
Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. The security of 
assessment materials, including secure data files, must be maintained at all times prior to 
and throughout the examination window. Failure to do so may constitute maladministration 
or malpractice. Any breach must be reported to Pearson immediately at mail to: 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson,  
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ General and vocational qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale 
from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual 
components are not graded. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) will be in 2019. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of 
sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result.

Appendix 2: Pearson World Class Qualification 
Design Principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational  
thought leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that 
Edexcel qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in 
qualification and assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner 
progression in today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-Class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
“I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.” Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process 
December 2015 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included, where appropriate: 
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidenced process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. The NRC 
framework is included alongside literacy and numeracy skills. 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and indicates the interpretation 
of the skill in this area. A full subject interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show 
opportunities for student development is given on the subject pages of our website:
