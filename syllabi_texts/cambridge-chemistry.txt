3  Subject content 
This syllabus gives you the flexibility to design a course that will interest, challenge and engage your learners. 
Where appropriate you are responsible for selecting resources and examples to support your learners’ study. These 
should be appropriate for the learners’ age, cultural background and learning context as well as complying with 
your school policies and local legal requirements.
All candidates should be taught the Core subject content. Candidates who are only taught the Core subject content 
can achieve a maximum of grade 5. Candidates aiming for grades 9 to 4 should be taught the Extended subject 
content. The Extended subject content includes both the Core and the Supplement. 
Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. Learners should pursue a fully integrated course which allows 
them to develop their experimental skills by doing practical work and investigations. 
Practical work helps students to:
	•
use equipment and materials accurately and safely 
	•
develop observational and problem-solving skills
	•
develop a deeper understanding of the syllabus topics and the scientific approach
	•
appreciate how scientific theories are developed and tested

Presentation of data
Taking readings
	•
Data values should be read from an instrument to an accuracy of one half of one of the smallest divisions on 
the scale.
	•
Interpolation between scale divisions should be to an accuracy of one half of a division. That is, where a reading 
occurs between two scale marks, it should be interpolated to the nearest half division.
Recording readings
	•
Data should be recorded so as to reflect the precision of the measuring instrument, i.e. the smallest difference 
that can be detected on the measuring scale should be reflected by the number of decimal places and unit 
given in the measurement.
	•
A measurement or calculated quantity must be accompanied by a correct unit, where appropriate.
	•
Each column of a table should be headed with the name or symbol of the measured or calculated quantity and 
the appropriate unit, e.g. time / s. The solidus (/) is to be used for separating the quantity and the unit in tables, 
graphs and charts.
	•
Each reading should be repeated, where appropriate and recorded.
	•
Units should not be included with data in the body of a table.
	•
The number of significant figures given for measured quantities should be appropriate to the measuring 
instrument used.
	•
The number of significant figures given for calculated quantities should be the same as the least number of 
significant figures in the raw data used in that specific calculation.
	•
A ratio should be expressed as x : y.
Graphs
	•
The column headings of a table can be directly transferred to the axes of a constructed graph.
	•
A graph should be drawn with a sharp pencil.
	•
The axes should be labelled with the name or symbol of the measured or calculated quantity and the 
appropriate unit, e.g. time / s.
	•
Unless instructed otherwise, the independent variable should be plotted on the x-axis (horizontal axis) and the 
dependent variable plotted on the y-axis (vertical axis).
	•
Unless instructed otherwise, the scales for the axes should allow more than half of the graph grid to be used in 
both directions, and be based on sensible ratios, e.g. 2 cm on the graph grid representing 1, 2 or 5 units of the 
variable (or 10, 20 or 50, etc.).
	•
Points on the graph should be clearly marked as crosses (×) or encircled dots (ʘ) of appropriate size. 
	•
Each data point should be plotted to an accuracy of one half of one of the smallest squares on the grid.
	•
A best-fit line (trend line) should be a single, thin, smooth straight-line or curve. Mathematical or least-squares 
methods of obtaining a best-fit line are not required. The line does not need to coincide exactly with any of the 
points; where there is scatter evident in the data, examiners would expect a roughly even distribution of points 
either side of the line over its entire length. Points that are clearly anomalous should be ignored when drawing 
the best-fit line.
	•
Candidates should be able to take readings from the graph by extrapolation or interpolation.
	•
Data values should be read from a line on a graph to an accuracy of one half of one of the smallest squares on 
the grid. The same accuracy should be used in reading off an intercept.
	•
The gradient of a straight line should be taken using a triangle whose hypotenuse extends over at least half the 
length of the candidate’s best-fit line, and this triangle should be marked on the graph.

Further guidance can be found in the following publications:
ASE, The Language of Mathematics in Science: A Guide for Teachers of 11–16 Science (2016).
ASE, The Language of Mathematics in Science: Teaching Approaches (2016).
www.ase.org.uk/mathsinscience 
Conventions (e.g. signs, symbols, terminology and nomenclature)
Candidates are expected to be familar with the nomenclature in the syllabus.
The syllabuses and question papers conform with generally accepted international practice. In particular, the 
following document, produced by the Association for Science Education (ASE), should be used as a guideline. 
Signs, Symbols and Systematics: The ASE Companion to 16–19 Science (2000).
The traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfuric acid and nitric acid will be used in question papers. 
Candidates will be credited for traditional or systematic names in their answers, except when specifically asked to 
use oxidation numbers to deduce or understand systematic names. 
Decimal markers 
In accordance with current ASE convention, decimal markers in examination papers will be a single dot on the line. 
Candidates are expected to follow this convention in their answers. 
Numbers 
Numbers from 1000 to 9999 will be printed without commas or spaces. Numbers greater than or equal to 10 000 
will be printed without commas. A space will be left between each group of three digits, e.g. 4 256 789.
Variables
Independent variables are the variables that are changed in a scientific experiment by the scientist. Changing an 
independent variable may cause a change in the dependent variable.
Dependent variables are the variables that are observed or measured in a scientific experiment. Dependent 
variables may change based on changes made to the independent variables.
Units 
To avoid any confusion concerning the symbol for litre, the equivalent quantity, the cubic decimetre (dm3) will be 
used in place of l or litre.
In practical work, candidates will be expected to use SI units or, where approriate, units approved by the BPIM 
for use with the SI (e.g. minute). A list of SI units and units approved for use with the SI may be found at 
www.bipm.org 
The use of imperial / customary units such as the inch and degree Fahrenheit are not acceptable and should be 
discouraged. In all examinations, where data is supplied for use in questions, candidates will be expected to use 
units that are consistent with the units supplied, and should not attempt conversion to other systems of units 
unless this is a requirement of the question.

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative 
zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has 
a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code 
is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available 
assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support 
they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases 
of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/entries 
Equality and inclusion
We have taken great care to avoid bias of any kind in the preparation of this syllabus and related assessment 
materials. In our effort to comply with the UK Equality Act (2010) we have taken all reasonable steps to avoid any 
direct and indirect discrimination.
The standard assessment arrangements may present barriers for candidates with impairments. Where a candidate 
is eligible, we may be able to make arrangements to enable that candidate to access assessments and receive 
recognition of their attainment. We do not agree access arrangements if they give candidates an unfair advantage 
over others or if they compromise the standards being assessed.
Candidates who cannot access the assessment of any component may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts of the assessment they have completed.
Information on access arrangements is in the Cambridge Handbook at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
Language
This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only.

After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard 
required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
	•
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment:
–	
confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in 
the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
	•
to show likely future success 
	
The outcomes:
–	
help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are 
more likely to be successful
–	
help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Chemistry will be published after the first assessment of the syllabus 
in 2023. Find more information at www.cambridgeinternational.org/0971
