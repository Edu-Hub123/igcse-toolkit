critical reading and comparison skills, where relevant, as well as their ability to produce clear 
and coherent writing using accurate Standard English. Wider reading of literary texts is also 
encouraged to help learners develop these skills.

where these relate to the text

the historical setting, time and location of the text 
• 
social and cultural contexts (for example, attitudes in society; expectations of different 
cultural groups) 
• 
the literary context of the text, for example, literary movements or genres 
• 
the way in which texts are received and engaged with by different audiences, at different 
times (for example, how a text may be read differently in the 21st century from when it 
was written).

Component 3: Modern Drama and Literary 
Heritage Texts (non-examined) 
The focus of this component is: 
Assignment A – Modern drama 
Assignment B – Literary heritage texts. 
Content 
Learners will study two set texts for this component: one of the modern drama set texts 
and one of the literary heritage set texts. The full list of set texts for this component is as 
follows. 
A choice of one text from Modern Drama: 
A View from the Bridge  
Arthur Miller 
An Inspector Calls  
J B Priestley 
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time  
Simon Stephens 
Kindertransport  
Diane Samuels 
Death and the King’s Horseman  
Wole Soyinka 
 
A choice of one text from Literary Heritage: 
Romeo and Juliet  
William Shakespeare 
Macbeth  
William Shakespeare 
The Merchant of Venice 
William Shakespeare 
Pride and Prejudice  
Jane Austen 
Great Expectations  
Charles Dickens 
The Scarlet Letter  
Nathaniel Hawthorne 
 
Teaching should focus on the study of whole texts, developing learners’ comprehension and 
critical reading skills, as well as their ability to produce clear and coherent writing using 
accurate Standard English. Wider reading of literary texts is also encouraged to help learners 
develop their skills. 
Understanding the relationship between a text and its context (AO4) 
There are different kinds, or categories, of context which affect writers’ work and the 
reader’s response to it. Teaching should include: 
• 
the writer's own life and individual situation, including the place and time of writing, only 
where these relate to the text 
• 
the historical setting, time and location of the text 
• 
social and cultural contexts (for example, attitudes in society; expectations of different 
cultural groups) 
• 
the literary context of the text, for example, literary movements or genres 
• 
the way in which texts are received and engaged with by different audiences, at different 
times (for example: how a text may be read differently in the 21st century from when it 
was written).

Assessment overview 
Component 3 is available as an alternative to Component 2. 
Component 3 Non-examined component assesses 40% of the total English Literature 
qualification.  
The assessment of the component is through two non-examined assignments, internally set 
and assessed, and externally moderated by Pearson. 
Assignment setting 
Learners must complete two non-examined assignments. 
Learners must respond to two non-examined assignments, which may be self-generated or 
devised by their teacher. Learners can be involved in choosing which texts to write about 
and the devising of the task. There is no requirement for learners in a cohort to write on 
different texts. Learners may all write on the same text. 
Assignment A 
The assignment should be based on one of the modern drama texts listed below.   
The assignment will be marked out of 30 with 15 marks for AO1 and 15 marks for AO2. 
A choice of one text from Modern Drama: 
A View from the Bridge  
Arthur Miller 
An Inspector Calls  
J B Priestley 
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time  
Mark Haddon (adapted 
by Simon Stephens) 
Kindertransport  
Diane Samuels 
Death and the King’s Horseman  
Wole Soyinka 
Setting the question 
The assignment must allow learners to access both AO1 and AO2. 
Assignments could take one of the following formats: 
• 
Explore the ways in which Priestley presents women in An Inspector Calls. You must 
consider language, form and structure. 
• 
In what ways does Miller present conflict in A View from the Bridge? You must consider 
language, form and structure. 
Assignment B 
The assignment should be based on one of the literary heritage texts listed below. 
The assignment will be marked out of 30 with 10 marks for AO1, 10 marks for AO2 and 10 
marks for AO4. 
A choice of one text from Literary Heritage: 
Romeo and Juliet  
William Shakespeare 
Macbeth  
William Shakespeare 
The Merchant of Venice 
William Shakespeare 
Pride and Prejudice  
Jane Austen 
Great Expectations  
Charles Dickens 
The Scarlet Letter  
Nathaniel Hawthorne

Specification – Issue 3 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
18
Setting the question 
Assignment B must allow learners to access AO1, AO2 and AO4. 
Assignments could take one of the following formats: 
• 
Jane Austen allows the reader to see many different forms of love in Pride and Prejudice.  
To what extent do you agree? You must consider language, form and structure and refer 
to the context of the novel. 
• 
How does Dickens portray city life in Great Expectations? You must consider language, 
form and structure and refer to the context of the novel. 
Teaching should focus on the study of whole texts, developing learners’ comprehension and 
critical reading, as well as their ability to produce clear and coherent writing using accurate 
Standard English. To help learners develop their skills, wider reading of literary texts is also 
encouraged.

Assignment taking 
Authenticity 
Learners must sign the Non-examined assessment authentication sheet in  
Appendix 2: Non-examined assessment authentication sheet to confirm that they have 
produced their non-examined assignment independently. 
Teachers must also sign the Non-examined assessment authentication sheet to confirm that 
learners have been sufficiently supervised to ensure the authenticity of the work.  
Collaboration 
Learners must work independently in producing their non-examined assignment.  
Teacher feedback 
• 
Teachers may advise learners in the production of non-examined assignment. Teachers 
may suggest general improvements to the non-examined assignment at a draft stage, 
but it is the learner’s responsibility to make any corrections and update the work.  
• 
Learner work must not be rewritten after it has been marked. 
• 
Learners should be informed at the start of the teaching that they must not plagiarise 
other work. Learners must acknowledge sources in their work and be advised how to do 
so. Teachers should be alert to essays derived from other sources – such as the internet 
or artificial intelligence (AI) – when signing the declaration on the non-examined 
assignment front sheet. 
Presentation of the work 
• 
Each piece of non-examined assignment should contain the learner’s name, the date on 
which the work was completed, the mark awarded and a brief teacher comment 
justifying the mark. This comment should be based on the assessment criteria for the 
mark range awarded. 
• 
Non-examined assignment pieces may be handwritten or word processed. 
Word count 
There is no prescribed word length for the non-examined component. The advisory word 
count for assignment A and assignment B is between 650 and 800 words and there is no 
penalty for exceeding this recommendation.

Assignment marking 
Assessment of non-examined component 
Teachers must mark non-examined assignment according to the assessment criteria in this 
specification. Teachers should use their professional judgement to apply the criteria 
appropriately and fairly to the work of learners.  
Learners should be awarded the appropriate mark within any range on a ‘best fit’ basis, 
balancing strengths and weaknesses in each essay. Answers may display characteristics of 
more than one level, and where this happens, markers must use professional judgement to 
decide which level is most appropriate. For example, a passage in the assignment may 
contain characteristics of Level 4 while the rest of the assignment tends towards Level 3. 
The outcome may therefore be a high Level 3.  
Standardisation of non-examined assessment 
Where there is more than one teacher of the non-examined assessment option in a centre, the 
centre should conduct internal standardisation. This can be carried out by paired marking. 
Completed non-examined assessment should be kept secure in the centre until at least six 
months after the examination session. Non-examined assessment may then be returned  
to learners. 
Final assessment of non-examined component at the end of the course 
There will be two marks out of 30 which will be combined to make one mark out of 60. At 
the end of the course, the non-examined assessment may be re-assessed and the marks 
adjusted in light of internal standardisation. 
Teachers should reward the quality of the writing and reading demonstrated in the non-
examined assignment. A second opinion, by a teacher other than the class teacher, will 
enable the centre to arrive at an objective judgement on achievement. 
Submission of non-examined assessment 
Towards the end of the course centres will be required to digitally submit a sample of non-
examined assessment to a Pearson-appointed non-examined assessment moderator. Final 
non-examined assessment marks for each learner should be recorded on the non-examined 
assessment front sheet in Appendix 2: Non-examined assessment authentication sheet.  
Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) document Instructions for 
conducting non-examination assessments for further information.

Security and backups 
It is the responsibility of the centre to keep the work that learners have submitted for 
assessment secure.  
Secure storage is defined as a securely locked cabinet or cupboard. The rules on storage 
also apply to electronic data. For materials stored electronically, centres are strongly advised 
to use firewall protection and virus-checking software, and to employ an effective backup 
strategy, so that an up-to-date archive of learners’ evidence is maintained.  
Further information 
For up-to-date advice on teacher involvement and administration of non-examination 
assessments, please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) document Instructions 
for conducting non-examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE specifications) available

6 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter learners for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is also available on our website. 
Learners should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved only one 
of the two International GCSEs. Learners or their advisers who have any doubts about 
subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to progress before 
embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all learners to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every learner. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• 
learners with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
learners who do not share that characteristic 
• 
all learners achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English only. All learner work must be in 
English. 
We recommend that learners have the ability to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  
Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in English Literature 
Specification – Issue 3 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
28
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow learners with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
• 
access the assessment 
• 
show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
learner with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Learners will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a learner with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular learner may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• 
the needs of the learner with the disability 
• 
the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• 
the cost of the adjustment 
• 
the likely impact of the adjustment on the learner with the disability and other learners. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a learner's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
learner’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an 
assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for information about how to apply for access arrangements and 
special consideration. 
For information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered before the candidate has signed 
the declaration of authentication form does not need to be reported to Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after the declaration of authenticity 
has been signed, and in examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ Form MI 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The completed form should be 
emailed to candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and 
supporting documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice.  
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with learner malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or undermines the integrity 
of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a JCQ 
Form M2a (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to: 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions 
lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ General and vocational qualifications: Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice.

Appendix 4: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for learners to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure that they are appropriate for 
the subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualifications. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in learners. 
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in English Literature and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full 
subject interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for learner 
development is given on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com.

Appendix 5: Glossary 
 
Term 
Definition 
Assessment 
objectives 
The requirements that learners need to meet to succeed in the 
qualification. Each assessment objective has a unique focus which 
is then targeted in examinations or non-examined assessment. 
Assessment objectives may be assessed individually or in 
combination.  
External 
assessment 
Assessment set and marked by an awarding organisation, taken by 
centres at the same time in the global region. 
JCQ 
Joint Council for Qualifications. This is a group of UK exam boards 
which develops policy related to the administration of 
examinations.  
Linear 
Linear qualifications have all assessments at the end of a course of 
study. It is not possible to take one assessment earlier in the 
course of study. 
Modular 
Modular qualifications contain units of assessment. These units can 
be taken during the course of study. The final qualification grade is 
worked out from the combined unit results.  
Non-examined 
assessment 
This is any assessment not sat in examination conditions at a fixed 
time and place. Non-examined assessment includes coursework, 
oral examinations and practical examinations. 
Raw marks 
Raw marks are the actual marks that learners achieve when taking 
an assessment. When calculating an overall grade, raw marks often 
need to be converted so that it is possible to see the proportionate 
achievement of a learner across all components of study.  
Uniform mark 
scale (UMS) 
Learner’s actual marks (or raw marks) will be converted into a UMS 
mark so that it is possible to see the proportionate result of a 
learner. The raw marks for each component may differ, but the 
Uniform Mark will be the same. 
Unit 
A modular qualification will be divided into a number of units. Each 
unit will have its own assessment.
