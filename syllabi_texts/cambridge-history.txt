Component 3 – Coursework
40 marks
This is an optional component. Candidates take either Component 3 or Paper 4.
The component is set and assessed internally by the centre, and externally moderated by Cambridge.
Coursework is an opportunity for teachers to introduce topics that are particularly relevant or of interest to their 
students. Coursework encourages independent learning. The skills developed through planning and delivering 
coursework support progression to higher-level studies.
Candidates produce one piece of extended writing, up to 2000 words in length, based on content taken from 
any of the depth studies. Centres can devise a depth study of their own, if they want to cover the history of 
countries not included in the current depth studies. The coursework should be based on a single question and 
should not be broken down into sub-questions. The coursework must be focused on the issue of significance 
and must target assessment objectives AO1 and AO2.
See also the section Guidance for centres on coursework and the Coursework Handbook.
The Coursework Handbook for this syllabus may be found on our School Support Hub: 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/support

Guidance for centres on coursework
General guidance on Component 3 Coursework is given below. For further detail, see the Coursework  
Handbook for this syllabus which is available on our School Support Hub: 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/support
The nature, setting and assessment of coursework
Candidates must complete one coursework assignment. This may be based on content taken from one of 
the syllabus depth studies or centres can devise a depth study of their own, if they want to cover topics not 
included in the syllabus depth studies. See the example questions below.
If centres are devising their own studies they should be within the date range covered by the syllabus and 
must not be based on the Core content in the syllabus. There must be sufficient debate within the topic and 
resources available. 
All candidates are expected to:
	•
respond to a single question about the significance of an individual, group, organisation, development, 
place or event. The question should allow them to:
–	
develop and support their own arguments and judgements
–	
meet the requirements of assessment objectives AO1 and AO2
	•
investigate the question stated in the title they have chosen
	•
produce an extended piece of writing of up to 2000 words in length (any part of the answer beyond 2000 
words will not be assessed)
	•
make critical use of a wide range of resources, referenced in footnotes and a bibliography.
The title of the essay should be evaluative, as shown in these example questions:
	•
How far was the New Deal a turning point in US history to 1941? 
	•
‘The work of Bletchley Park was very significant during the Second World War.’ Discuss.
	•
How far were the Camp David meetings a turning point for the Middle East?
	•
Assess the significance of the Parihaka community in New Zealand in the years 1866–81.
	•
How far was the Atlanta Compromise of 1895 a turning point for Black Americans?
	•
How significant was Juan Perón for Argentina?
	•
Assess the significance of the Seneca Falls Convention in the US by 1920.

Supervising coursework
A general discussion on the progress of coursework is a natural part of the teacher–candidate relationship, as 
it is for other parts of the course. If plans and first drafts are completed under teacher supervision, you can be 
sure of the authenticity of the final coursework. Candidates can draft and redraft work, but you should only give 
brief summative comments on progress during this drafting phase.
Coursework must be a candidate’s own, unaided work. Unless there is subject-specific guidance that says 
otherwise, you can support candidates by reviewing their work before it is handed in for final assessment. 
You can do this orally or through written feedback. Your advice should be kept at a general level so that the 
candidate leads the discussion and makes the suggestions for any amendments. You must not give detailed 
advice to individual candidates or groups of candidates on how their work can be improved to meet the 
assessment criteria. You should not correct or edit draft coursework.
For further information about supervising coursework, see the Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of 
assessment at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Authenticity and academic honesty/avoidance of plagiarism
It is the centre’s responsibility to make sure all assessed work is the candidate’s original work. Candidates must 
not submit someone else’s work as their own, or use material produced by someone else without citing and 
referencing it properly. You should make candidates aware of the academic conventions governing quotation 
and reference to the work of others, and teach candidates how to use them. 
A candidate taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as their own is an example of 
plagiarism. It is your responsibility as a teacher to prevent plagiarism from happening and to detect it if it does 
happen. For more information, search for ‘Preventing plagiarism – guidance for teachers’ on our website at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/teachingandassessment 
For work submitted using our eSubmission portal, you must make a collective declaration of authenticity for the 
work of all candidates that you submit. 
Guidance on using levels-based mark schemes
Marking of work should be positive, rewarding achievement where possible, but clearly differentiating across 
the whole range of marks, where appropriate.
The marker should look at the work as a whole and then make a judgement about which level is the best 
fit. In practice, work does not always match one level precisely and candidates do not have to meet all the 
requirements of a level before an answer can be placed in that level. A judgement may need to be made 
between two or more levels. In making this judgement, the question to be asked about an answer is ‘does it 
match, e.g. Level 4 better than it matches Level 3?’
Once a best-fit level has been identified, use the following guidance to decide on a specific mark:
	•
If the candidate’s work convincingly meets the level description, award the highest mark.
	•
If the candidate’s work adequately meets the level description, award the most appropriate mark in the 
middle of the range (where middle marks are available).
	•
If the candidate’s work just meets the level description, award the lowest mark.

Using the samples database
The samples database explains everything you need to know about administering coursework, speaking tests 
and examined coursework. 
Use the database to find out:
	•
when and how to submit your marks for moderated coursework and non-coursework tests
	•
when and how to submit your candidates’ work
	•
which forms to complete and return with your candidates’ work.
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples will ask you for:
	•
your country/territory
	•
the syllabus code (i.e. 0977 for this syllabus).
The database will then take you to the information you need, including dates and methods of submission of 
candidates’ marks and work, as well as any forms you may need to complete.
Recording and submitting candidates’ marks and work
Please refer to the samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples for information, dates 
and methods of submission of candidates’ marks and work.
You should follow the instructions for Coursework 0977/03 on the samples database at  
www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples about how to submit candidates’ work and record candidates’ 
marks.

For specific syllabuses and components, centres need to submit marks and work using our eSubmission  
portal (see the samples database for instructions for each coursework component). Further 
information is available in the Administrative guide: Preparing and submitting work using eSubmission 
at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
You should record marks on the relevant forms which you should download each year from the samples 
database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples. Follow the instructions on the forms to complete 
them. The marks on these forms must be identical to the marks you submit to Cambridge International.
Internal moderation
If more than one teacher in your centre is marking internal assessments, you must make arrangements 
to moderate or standardise your teachers’ marking so that all candidates are assessed to a common 
standard. (If only one teacher is marking internal assessments, no internal moderation is necessary.) 
You can find further information on the process of internal moderation on the samples database at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples
You should record the internally moderated marks for all candidates on the relevant forms from the samples 
database and submit these marks to Cambridge International according to the instructions set out in the 
Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of assessment.
External moderation
Cambridge International will externally moderate all internally assessed components.
	•
You must submit the marks of all candidates to Cambridge International.
	•
You must also submit the marked work of a sample of candidates to Cambridge International. 
The sample you submit to Cambridge International should include examples of the marking of each teacher. 
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples explains how the sample will be 
selected.
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples also provides details of how to submit 
the marks and work. 
External moderators will produce a short report for each centre with feedback on your marking and 
administration of the assessment.

administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more 
information about our administrative processes at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Before you start
Previous study
We do not expect learners starting this course to have previously studied History. 
Guided learning hours
We design Cambridge IGCSE syllabuses based on learners having about 130 guided learning hours for each 
subject during the course but this is for guidance only. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the 
qualification may vary according to local practice and their previous experience of the subject.
Availability and timetables 
All Cambridge schools are allocated to one of six administrative zones. Each zone has a specific timetable. 
This syllabus is not available in all administrative zones. To find out about availability check the syllabus page at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as 
administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their 
location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment 
options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the 
administrative zone and the available assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the 
support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all 
other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes and carry forward marks
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/entries 
Marks achieved in Component 3 Coursework can be carried forward to future series, subject to the 
requirements set out in the Cambridge Handbook. 
Candidates cannot resubmit, in whole or in part, coursework from a previous series. To confirm what entry 
options are available to carry forward marks for this syllabus, refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries 
for the relevant series. Regulations for carrying forward internally assessed marks can be found in the 
Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide

Accessibility and equality
Syllabus and assessment design 
Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination in our syllabuses and assessment 
materials. We aim to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and with 
other protected characteristics. In addition, the language and layout used are designed to make our materials 
as accessible as possible. This gives all learners the opportunity, as fairly as possible, to demonstrate their 
knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the requirement to make reasonable adjustments 
during the assessment process.
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International 
complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for 
candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise 
be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we 
may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by 
minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and 
understanding in an assessment. 
Important: 
	•
Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment 
and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes 
a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and 
integrity of the assessment. 
	•
Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our 
standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not 
included in the list of standard access arrangements. 
	•
Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts they have completed.

After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the 
standard required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
	•
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment:
–	
confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified 
in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
	•
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes:
–	
help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students 
are more likely to be successful
–	
help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) History will be published after the first assessment of the 
syllabus in 2024. Find more information at www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
