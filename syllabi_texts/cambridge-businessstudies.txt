Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative 
zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has 
a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code 
is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available 
assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support 
they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases 
of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes 
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/entries 
Equality and inclusion
We have taken great care to avoid bias of any kind in the preparation of this syllabus and related assessment 
materials. In our effort to comply with the UK Equality Act (2010) we have taken all reasonable steps to avoid any 
direct and indirect discrimination.
The standard assessment arrangements may present barriers for candidates with impairments. Where a candidate 
is eligible, we may be able to make arrangements to enable that candidate to access assessments and receive 
recognition of their attainment. We do not agree access arrangements if they give candidates an unfair advantage 
over others or if they compromise the standards being assessed.
Candidates who cannot access the assessment of any component may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts of the assessment they have completed.
Information on access arrangements is in the Cambridge Handbook at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide

After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard 
required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
	•
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment:
–	
confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in 
the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
	•
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes:
–	
help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are 
more likely to be successful
–	
help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Business Studies will be published after the first assessment of the 
syllabus in 2020. Find more information at www.cambridgeinternational.org/0986
