Why choose the Pearson Edexcel International 
GCSE in Geography? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the international subject community. Based 
on that feedback, we have made changes that will engage students and give them 
opportunities to gain skills that will support progression to further study of geography, and 
to enhance their educational or employment prospects. This qualification enables students to 
explore the world, the challenges it faces and their own place in it, and to help prepare them 
to succeed in their chosen pathway. The content and assessment approach for this 
qualification has been designed to meet students’ needs in the following ways. 
Two-paper assessment – a new, two-paper model allows students to focus on physical 
and human geography. The qualification will test knowledge and understanding, as well as 
analytical, evaluation and fieldwork skills in both papers. 
Concepts and content – the content in both Paper 1: Physical geography and Paper 2: 
Human geography is engaging and accessible for all students. The material is appropriate 
and relevant for progression, building understanding and awareness of a range of 
geographical concepts and skills, including fieldwork. 
Localised content: teachers can localise the fieldwork and content covered to suit the 
needs and interests of a range of international learners in different regions.    
Clear and straightforward question papers – our question papers are clear and 
accessible for students of all ability ranges. A range of question styles will be used.  
Our mark schemes are straightforward so that the assessment requirements are clear. 
Broad and deep development of skills – the design of the revised International GCSE 
aims to extend students’ knowledge by broadening and deepening skills. For example, 
students will: 
• develop and apply a holistic range of knowledge and understanding of geographical 
concepts and skills, including fieldwork 
• present and analyse data, draw conclusions and evaluate information from different 
sources 
• develop awareness of global issues and challenges and that, in moving towards a 
sustainable future, people have different views and attitudes to the environment. 
Progression to A Level – International GCSEs enable successful progression to Level 3 
qualifications (such as the International A Level in Geography) and beyond, in geography 
and other subjects. Through our world-class qualification development process, we have 
consulted international geography teaching experts to validate this qualification and endorse 
its content, skills development and assessment structure.

Fieldwork questions will include questions set in a familiar and unfamiliar fieldwork context.  
Questions set in a familiar fieldwork context will require students to interpret, analyse, 
evaluate and make judgements about their own fieldwork (AO3). They will also require 
students to communicate their findings (AO4).  
Questions set in an unfamiliar fieldwork context will be set in in the fieldwork environment 
you have studied and will relate to the fieldwork investigation you have done (as set out in 
column 4 in the table below), they will however use unfamiliar fieldwork data and students 
will need to show that they can apply their fieldwork understanding and skills to interpret 
and analyse this data.

Assessment of fieldwork skills – Section B 
Fieldwork is assessed in Section B of Paper 2. Students are required to complete one 
geographical enquiry involving fieldwork relating to one topic in Paper 2. 
Paper 2: Human geography 
• Economic activity and energy. 
• Rural environments. 
• Urban environments. 
Centres must ensure that: 
• Primary data collection includes quantitative and qualitative techniques. 
• Secondary data collection includes the use of at least two different secondary data 
sources for your chosen environment. 
Practical skills 
As part of – and in addition to – undertaking the geographical enquiry, students should 
acquire and be able to apply the following skills: 
• graphical skills – compiling graphs and flow lines, using proportional symbols, 
annotating maps, diagrams and photographs 
• map skills (including use of digital maps) – using grid references, understanding scales, 
recognising symbols, identifying landforms and human features of the landscape 
• photo-interpretation skills – reading vertical and oblique aerial photographs and 
satellite images, including GIS 
• sketching skills – communicating ideas through simple sketch maps and field sketches 
• spatial awareness – identifying the relative locations and relationships between 
features. 
Cognitive enquiry skills 
Students should acquire and be able to apply the following skills: 
• analysis of findings – reviewing and interpreting quantitative and qualitative 
information using appropriate media 
• use of statistical skills – simple descriptive statistics, such as lines of best fit, means, 
medians, modes, etc. 
• conflict resolution skills – identifying the views of interested people (stakeholders), 
recognising that stakeholders may have strongly different attitudes and feelings towards 
a particular issue 
• evaluation of findings – appraisal and review of data and information to see if these are 
accurate and suitable for the purpose, or misleading and unreliable.

Fieldwork questions will include questions set in a familiar and unfamiliar fieldwork context.  
Questions set in a familiar fieldwork context will require students to interpret, analyse, 
evaluate and make judgements about their own fieldwork (AO3). They will also require 
students to communicate their findings (AO4).  
Questions set in an unfamiliar fieldwork context will be set in in the fieldwork environment 
you have studied and will relate to the fieldwork investigation you have done (as set out in 
column 4 in the table below), they will however use unfamiliar fieldwork data and students 
will need to show that they can apply their fieldwork understanding and skills to interpret 
and analyse this data (AO3) and communicate their findings (AO4).

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is available on our website. 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers who have any 
doubts about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
• access the assessment 
• show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• the needs of the student with the disability 
• the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• the cost of the adjustment; and 
• the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an 
assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High 
Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on 
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). 
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson, 
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding 
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ General and vocational qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale 
from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual 
components are not graded. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Geography will be in 2019. Students whose level of achievement is 
below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be recorded on a 
certificate will receive an unclassified U result.

Practical geographical enquiry skills 
Throughout their course, students need to acquire a range of geographical skills through 
fieldwork and linked practical exercises. Fieldwork is integral to the enquiry process that 
underpins the qualification. 
Ofsted (2011 subject report) and national NGOs support the view that good and regular 
fieldwork motivates learners and enhances their understanding of geography. There is 
evidence that fieldwork encourages a higher than average take-up of academic 
qualifications. 
Fieldwork and enquiry skills should include: 
• pre-fieldwork planning – designing a fieldwork investigation, as per the qualification 
content 
• primary field skills – undertaking a field investigation, the need for sampling, data 
collection and recording techniques. This can be undertaken within the school grounds or 
immediate locality 
• presentation, analysis, conclusions and evaluation skills – using a range of data 
presentation techniques, analysis of data and drawing conclusions, evaluating the 
techniques used and the conclusions drawn. 
Fieldwork and exceptional circumstances 
Pearson recognises that for some centres and/or individuals, fieldwork (specifically first-hand 
data collection activities) can be constrained by: 
(i) 
geographical location/physical nature of the region 
(ii) 
cultural/religious exceptions 
(iii) illness 
(iv) physical disability; or 
(v) 
security. 
In these rare circumstances, other fieldwork data could be used instead, e.g. from another 
agency/organisation, books/magazines or from other students who were able to collect the 
data themselves (including from previous cohorts). More examples of other sources of 
fieldwork data, including relevant websites, can be found in Pearson Edexcel International 
GCSE in Geography teacher support materials. All other aspects of the enquiry process 
should remain unchanged for those learners (Stages 1–3 and 5–7 in the enquiry process) 
who have not collected their own data. These students should work with the substitute data, 
e.g. graphing, analysis, conclusions, evaluations etc., as if it were their own. 
When exceptional circumstances are employed as part of the fieldwork process, either for 
an individual, group or cohort, centres must justify their particular circumstances to Pearson 
through contact with Pearson’s Ask the Expert Service or the Geography Subject Advisor 
both available from qualifications.pearson.com/en/subjects/geography

Comment on the accuracy, validity and reliability of the conclusions. 
Describe the findings, explain possible reasons, make links between 
patterns etc. Simple statistical tests may be used. Review 
information and then bring it together to form a conclusion, drawing 
on evidence and reasoned chains of argument, e.g. measures of 
central tendency, spread and cumulative frequency. Students should 
revisit predictions/hypotheses (Stage 2). 
Appropriate data collection methods that will help answer the 
questions being investigated. Use appropriate equipment to ensure 
accuracy and reliability. Develop recording sheets for measurement 
and observation. 
What are the possible fieldwork opportunities presented by the

GIS, magazines, books, i.e. secondary information and/or data. 
Opportunity to develop own ideas and models or use existing ones. 
Develop predictions, hypotheses and/or suitable key questions. 
Use ICT to manage, collate and process information, e.g. shared 
spreadsheets and VLE/‘cloud’ to store for easy retrieval. Use ICT 
and/or hand-drawn graphical skills to present information in a 
suitable way. 
Note: in constrained circumstances (see page 51) other data may 
be used to supplement primary data.

Appendix 6: Fieldwork requirements 
The table below specifies the minimum types and range of fieldwork (including qualitative, 
quantitative and secondary data) required for the options available. 
Candidates are required to undertake fieldwork from topics in Paper 1 and Paper 2, so that 
they can complete the assessments. 
 
Enquiry process 
point 
General focus and details of fieldwork 
1. Enquiry 
question 
Students should have an opportunity to develop understanding of the 
kinds of questions that can be investigated through fieldwork for the 
chosen topic. 
Students should have an opportunity to develop a question(s) based on 
their location and the task. 
2. Fieldwork 
methods 
Fieldwork data collection must include quantitative and qualitative 
methods for each of the two investigations – details of these are found 
on pages 17-18 (physical geography) and page 28-30 (human 
geography). 
Students should have an opportunity to consider sample size, sampling 
strategies and data-collection design to help them understand issues of 
reliability and accuracy of data. Students need to understand the 
purpose of each of the data collection methods for the investigation. 
3. Secondary 
data sources 
Students must use at least two different secondary sources of data. 
Details of these are found on pages 17-18 (physical geography) and 
pages 28-30 (human geography). 
4. Processing 
and 
presenting 
data 
Both primary and secondary data should be processed, including the use 
of tally charts, calculation of means and calculation of percentages. 
Primary and secondary data should be presented in map form using 
simple GIS applications. 
Simple (pie, bar, line) and more complex (compound, radial, scatter) 
graphs should be used to present primary and secondary data. 
Appropriate ways should be used to present qualitative data. 
5. Analysis and 
explanation 
Primary and secondary data should be analysed for meaning, both 
individually and together, to draw out links, contrasts and comparisons. 
6. Coming to 
conclusions 
Conclusions drawn should relate to the extent to which the results from 
the investigation fit accepted theories and whether there are any further 
implications of the results for people and the environment. Conclusions 
must draw on both primary and secondary evidence, and students must 
consider anomalous and/or unexpected results. 
7. Reflecting 
on data, 
methods 
and 
conclusions 
Students should include the accuracy and reliability of primary and 
secondary data and the extent to which conclusions are reliable. They 
should analyse possible ways to improve results and consider the extent 
to which these data collection techniques could be used for other 
fieldwork investigations.

Appendix 7: Health and safety in the field 
All centres must comply with their local and national rules/guidance, laws and good practice 
relating to health and safety, for example the requirements of relevant legislation and codes 
of practice in the UK, including the Department for Education document Health and Safety: 
Advice on legal duties and powers for local authorities, school leaders, school staff and 
governing bodies and the Health and Safety Executive document School Trips and Outdoor 
Learning Activities: Tackling the health and safety myths. 
Centres must ensure safe working is an inherent part of practical learning, for example 
students know and understand the importance of ensuring their own safety and that of 
others. This could involve learners developing risk assessments as part of the preparation for 
fieldwork (Stage 3 – Design), for example by using Google Maps™ and Google Street View™ 
to assess likely hazards and/or risk. 
Health and safety learning must include the concepts of: 
• hazard – the danger that could reasonably be expected to cause harm, e.g. contact with 
slippery rocks next to a stream 
• impact/severity – how someone might be harmed 
• risk – the chance that someone will be harmed by a particular hazard, e.g. a fall, slip or 
trip. 
For example, a risk rating can be developed, based on likelihood and severity (or worst case 
outcome). When working in a river, the likelihood of slipping on wet rocks may be described 
as ‘infrequent’ (a score of 3/5), while the severity could be ‘injury’ (a score of 3/5). These 
two together give a risk-rating score of 9/25 (3 × 3/5 × 5), which would indicate that a 
control should be in place to minimise the chance of injury through slipping. 
Additional support on this aspect of the specification is available in the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Geography teacher support materials.

developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational thought 
leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that Edexcel 
qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in qualification and 
assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner progression in 
today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
‘I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.’ Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process 
December 2015 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included, where appropriate: 
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidenced process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 9: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
The NRC framework is included alongside literacy and numeracy skills. 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table on the next page sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that 
can be found in geography and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full 
subject interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for students’ 
development is provided on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com

Appendix 10: Glossary 
 
Term 
Definition 
Assessment 
objectives 
The requirements that students need to meet to succeed in the 
qualification. Each assessment objective has a unique focus, which 
is then targeted in examinations or coursework. Assessment 
objectives may be assessed individually or in combination. 
External 
assessment 
An examination that is held at the same time and place in a global 
region. 
JCQ 
Joint Council for Qualifications. This is a group of UK exam boards 
which develop policy related to the administration of examinations. 
Linear 
Linear qualifications have all assessments at the end of a course of 
study. It is not possible to take one assessment earlier in the 
course of study. 
Raw marks 
Raw marks are the actual marks that students achieve when taking 
an assessment. When calculating an overall grade raw marks often 
need to be converted so that it is possible to see the proportionate 
achievement of a student across all units of study.
