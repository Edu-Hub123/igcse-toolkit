Why choose Pearson Edexcel qualifications? 
Pearson – the world’s largest education company  
Edexcel academic qualifications are from Pearson, the UK’s largest awarding organisation. 
With over 3.4 million students studying our academic and vocational qualifications 
worldwide, we offer internationally recognised qualifications to schools, colleges and 
employers globally.  
Pearson is recognised as the world’s largest education company, allowing us to drive 
innovation and provide comprehensive support for Pearson Edexcel students in acquiring the 
knowledge and skills they need for progression in study, work and life.  
A heritage you can trust 
The background to Pearson becoming the UK’s largest awarding organisation began in 1836, 
when a royal charter gave the University of London its first powers to conduct exams and 
confer degrees on its students. With over 150 years of international education experience, 
Edexcel qualifications have firm academic foundations, built on the traditions and rigour 
associated with Britain’s educational system.

Why choose the Pearson Edexcel International 
GCSE in Physics? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the international school, UK independent 
school and language teaching community including a large number of teachers. We have 
made changes that will engage students and give them skills that will support progression to 
further study in physics, physical science and other related subjects. Our content and 
assessment approach has been designed to meet students’ needs and be consistent with our 
approach across the sciences. 
Key qualification features 
At Pearson, we offer separate science qualifications in Biology, Human Biology, Chemistry and 
Physics, as well as Double Award and Single Award Science qualifications – these have been 
designed to meet different students’ needs. The content and assessment approach in all our 
science qualifications has been designed to meet students’ needs in the following ways. 
• Content that is interesting and engaging for students but is also designed to ensure good 
preparation, both for those continuing to further study and for those wishing to work in a 
physics-related field. 
• There are opportunities to ‘localise’ the content to make it more relevant for students in 
their own country. 
Clear and straightforward question papers 
• Our question papers are clear and accessible for students of all abilities. Our mark 
schemes are straightforward, so that the assessment requirements are clear. 
Broad and deep development of students' skills 
• The design of the revised international GCSE aims to extend students' knowledge and 
understanding by broadening and deepening skills, for example students develop the 
ability to: 
– 
focus on practical skills through a number of practicals listed in the specification 
content. These can be supplemented with other suggested practicals.  
The skills developed will be assessed through questions in written examinations  
– 
improve students’ analytical and logic skills by applying understanding of scientific 
concepts and principles to a range of situations. This will include some examination 
questions that are more problem-solving in style 
– 
address the need for mathematical skills to complement students’ physics skills  
by covering a range of mathematical areas. 
Progression 
International GCSE qualifications enable successful progression to A Level and beyond. 
Through our World Class Qualification development process, we have consulted with 
International Advanced Level and GCE A Level teachers as well as higher education 
professionals to validate the appropriateness of the qualification, including its content, skills 
development and assessment structure. 
Courses to suit your students’ needs and interests 
Teachers of physics have a choice of International GCSE courses to deliver, each giving 
different levels of depth to meet students’ needs. As well as the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Physics, students can also be taught our International GCSE in Science 
(Double Award) or our International GCSE in Science (Single Award). These courses offer a 
 
Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Physics

Experimental skills 
The best way to develop experimental skills is to embed practical investigations in teaching 
or theory. The development of knowledge and experimental skills can then happen together, 
leading to secure acquisition of both knowledge and skills. 
Our practical investigations are embedded within Section 3: Physics content as specification 
points in italics. The skills developed through these and other practicals will be assessed 
through written examinations. 
In the assessment of experimental skills, students may be tested on their ability to: 
• solve problems set in a practical context 
• apply scientific knowledge and understanding in questions with a practical context 
• devise and plan investigations, using scientific knowledge and understanding when 
selecting appropriate techniques 
• demonstrate or describe appropriate experimental and investigative methods, including 
safe and skilful practical techniques 
• make observations and measurements with appropriate precision, record these 
methodically and present them in appropriate ways 
• identify independent, dependent and control variables 
• use scientific knowledge and understanding to analyse and interpret data to draw 
conclusions from experimental activities that are consistent with the evidence 
• communicate the findings from experimental activities, using appropriate technical 
language, relevant calculations and graphs 
• assess the reliability of an experimental activity 
• evaluate data and methods, taking into account factors that affect accuracy and validity. 
Calculators 
Students will be expected to have access to a suitable electronic calculator for all 
examination papers. Calculators that allow for the retrieval of text or formulae, or  
QWERTY keyboards will not be allowed for use in examinations.

Entries and forbidden combinations 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International information manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is also available on our website. 
Students should be advised that if they take two qualifications in the same subject, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved only one 
of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers, who have any doubts 
about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to progress 
before embarking on their programmes. 
This qualification may not be taken alongside: 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Science (Double Award) (Linear) (4SD0) 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Science (Double Award) (Modular) (4XSD1) 
• Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Physics (Modular) (4XPH1). 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English only. All student work must be in 
English.  
We recommend that students have the ability to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
• access the assessment 
• show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• the needs of the student with the disability 
• the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• the cost of the adjustment 
• the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation or unreasonable timeframes or if it affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special considerations 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a candidate's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the  
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of  
attainment in an assessment.

Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special considerations.

considerations, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment which undermines the integrity of the qualifications 
or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered before the candidate has signed 
the declaration of authentication form does not need to be reported to Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after the declaration of authenticity has 
been signed, and in examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ Form M1 (available at 
http://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The completed form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with 
Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment, or undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com.  
Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale from 9 
to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are not graded. 
The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Physics is in 
June 2019. Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be 
of sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
Student recruitment and progression  
Pearson’s policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications is that:  
• they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard  
• they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
• equal opportunities exist for all students.

Appendix 2: Pearson World Class Qualification 
design principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational thought 
leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that Pearson 
Edexcel qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in 
qualification and assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner 
progression in today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
‘I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.’ Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class 
Qualifications for the International GCSE development process 
May 2014 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world class qualification 
development process that has included: 
• extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
• benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
• establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidence-based process, which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills  
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table on the next page sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that 
can be found in physics and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full subject 
interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for students’ development is 
provided on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com

data/information to form a judgement.  
Complete 
Requires the completion of a table/diagram. 
Deduce 
Draw/reach conclusion(s) from the information provided. 
Describe 
To give an account of something. Statements in the response 
need to be developed, as they are often linked but do not 
need to include a justification or reason. 
Design 
Plan or invent a procedure from existing principles/ideas. 
Determine 
The answer must have an element that is quantitative from 
the stimulus provided, or must show how the answer can be 
reached quantitatively. To gain maximum marks, there must 
be a quantitative element to the answer. 
Discuss 
 
• Identify the issue/situation/problem/argument that is 
being assessed within the question. 
• Explore all aspects of an 
issue/situation/problem/argument. 
• Investigate the issue/situation etc. by reasoning or 
argument. 
Draw 
Produce a diagram using a ruler or freehand. 
Estimate 
Find an approximate value, number or quantity from a 
diagram/given data or through a calculation. 
Evaluate 
 
Review information (e.g. data, methods) then bring it 
together to form a conclusion, drawing on evidence including 
strengths, weaknesses, alternative actions, relevant data or 
information. Come to a supported judgement of a subject’s 
quality and relate it to its context. 
Explain 
 
An explanation requires a justification/exemplification of a 
point. The answer must contain some element of 
reasoning/justification – this can include mathematical 
explanations.
