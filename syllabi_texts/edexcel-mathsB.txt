Broaden and deepen students’ skills – We have designed the International GCSE to 
extend students’ knowledge by broadening and deepening skills, for example: 
• 
students develop problem-solving skills by translating problems in mathematical or  
non-mathematical contexts 
• 
students will develop reasoning skills through exercises such as presenting arguments 
and proofs, and making deductions and drawing conclusions from mathematical 
information.  
Comparable to GCSE – We have designed our International GCSE qualification to be of 
equivalent standard to Pearson’s regulated GCSE qualification. This ensures that 
International GCSEs are recognised globally and provide learners with the same progression 
routes.  
Supports progression to A Level – Our qualifications enable successful progression to  
A Level and beyond. Through our world-class qualification development process, we have 
consulted with International A Level and GCE A Level teachers, as well as university 
professors to validate the appropriacy of this qualification including the content, skills and 
assessment structure.  
Centres wishing to teach mathematics using a different approach to meet their students’ 
needs can use our Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Mathematics (Specification A) or 
extend students’ study with Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Further Pure 
Mathematics. More information about all of our qualifications can be found on our Edexcel

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is available on our website. 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers who have any 
doubts about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• 
students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• 
all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will only be available in English. All student work must be in 
English. 
We recommend that students are able to read and write in English at level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
• 
access the assessment 
• 
show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
 
Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Mathematics (Specification B) –  
Specification – Issue 1 – January 2016  © Pearson Education Limited 2016 
28 
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• 
the needs of the student with the disability 
• 
the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• 
the cost of the adjustment; and 
• 
the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, time frames or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in an 
assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk 
Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or that undermines the integrity of the qualifications 
or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson, 
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice.

Specification – Issue 1 – January 2016  © Pearson Education Limited 2016 
29 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or that undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to: Investigations Team, Pearson,  
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ General and vocational qualifications: Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a six-grade scale from 
9 to 4, with 3 allowed using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual 
components are not graded. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in Mathematics (Specification B) will be in June 2018. Students whose 
level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to 
be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result.  
Student recruitment and progression  
Pearson’s policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications is that:  
• 
they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard  
• 
they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
• 
equal opportunities exist for all students. 
Prior learning and other requirements  
The qualification builds on the content, knowledge and skills developed in the Key Stage 3 
Programme of Study (ages 11–14) or international equivalences for Mathematics.

Appendix 2: Pearson World Class Qualification 
Design Principles 
Pearson’s world-class qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering.  
 
 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational thought-
leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that Edexcel 
qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in qualification and 
assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner progression in 
today’s fast changing world.  
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
“I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.” Sir Michael Barber. 
Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-class Qualifications for 
International GCSE development processes 
“We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world-class qualification 
development process that has included:  
• 
Extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world  
• 
Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand  
 
Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Mathematics (Specification B) –  
Specification – Issue 1 – January 2016  © Pearson Education Limited 2016 
36 
• 
Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidence-based process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are outstanding 
for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills  
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework.  
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure they are appropriate for the 
subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualification. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in Mathematics (Specification B) and 
indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full subject interpretation of each skill, 
with mapping to show opportunities for students’ development is provided on the subject
