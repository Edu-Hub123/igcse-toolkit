Why choose Pearson Edexcel qualifications? 
Pearson – the world’s largest education company  
Edexcel academic qualifications are from Pearson, the UK’s largest awarding organisation. 
With over 3.4 million students studying our academic and vocational qualifications 
worldwide, we offer internationally recognised qualifications to schools, colleges and 
employers globally.  
Pearson is recognised as the world’s largest education company, allowing us to drive 
innovation and provide comprehensive support for Pearson Edexcel students in acquiring the 
knowledge and skills they need for progression in study, work and life.  
A heritage you can trust 
The background to Pearson becoming the UK’s largest awarding organisation began in 1836, 
when a royal charter gave the University of London its first powers to conduct exams and 
confer degrees on its students. With over 150 years of international education experience, 
Pearson Edexcel qualifications have a firm academic foundation, built on the traditions and 
rigour associated with Britain’s educational system.

Pearson’s leading online marking technology has been shown to produce exceptionally 
reliable results, demonstrating that at every stage, Pearson Edexcel qualifications maintain 
the highest standards. 
Developed to Pearson’s world class qualifications standards 
Pearson’s world class standards mean that all Pearson Edexcel qualifications are developed 
to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. We work collaboratively with a panel 
of educational thought leaders and assessment experts, to ensure that Pearson Edexcel 
qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice and maintain a 
consistent standard.

Why choose Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in 
English Language (Specification A)? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the international school, UK independent 
school and language teaching community, including a large number of teachers. We have 
made changes that will engage International students and give them skills that will support 
progression to the further study of English and a wide range of other subjects.  
Key qualification features 
At Pearson Edexcel we offer both Specification A and Specification B International GCSE 
qualifications for English Language – these have been designed to meet different student 
needs. The content and assessment approach for this Specification A qualification has been 
designed to meet students' needs in the following ways:  
Text types and text choices – we have ensured that the texts studied are engaging, 
suitable for all students, and that they include a diverse range of writers. The texts include 
poetry and prose as well as literary non-fiction.  
Choice of non-examined and examined assessment – we have provided alternative 
assessment routes to suit different centre and student needs across the world.  
Clear and straightforward question papers – our question papers are clear and 
accessible for students of all abilities. Our mark schemes are straightforward, so that the 
assessment requirements are clear.  
Broad and deep development of students’ skills – the design of the revised 
International GCSE aims to extend students’ knowledge by broadening and deepening skills. 
For example, students develop the ability to: 
• 
read and respond to material from a variety of sources 
• 
make comparisons between texts and analyse the ways in which writers achieve their 
effects 
• 
construct and convey meaning in written language, matching style to audience and 
purpose.  
Development of spoken language skills – students are able to develop their 
understanding of the spoken word through an optional speaking and listening endorsement. 
Progression International GCSE qualifications enable successful progression onto A level 
and beyond. Through our World Class Qualification development process, we have consulted 
with International A level and GCE A level teachers as well as higher education professionals 
to validate the appropriateness of this qualification, including its content, skills development 
and assessment structure. 
Centres wishing to teach English Language using a different approach to meet their  
students’ needs can use our Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in English Language 
(Specification B). We also offer International GCSE qualifications in English Literature and 
English as a Second Language within our overall English offer. More information about all  
of our qualifications can be found on our website (qualifications.pearson.com) on the

3 English Language (Specification A) content 
Component 1: Non-fiction Texts and Transactional 
Writing (examined) 
The focus of this component is: 
Section A: Non-fiction texts – study and analyse selections from a range of non-fiction texts. 
Section B: Transactional Writing – explore and develop transactional writing skills. 
Content 
Students should read a variety of high-quality, challenging non-fiction texts, in preparation 
to respond to one unseen non-fiction text in the examination. They should be able to read 
substantial pieces of writing, including whole and extended texts that make significant 
demands in terms of content, structure and the quality of the language. Throughout the 
qualification, students should develop the skills of interpretation and analysis. 
Text types studied should include a range of non-fiction forms, such as journalism  
(for example articles and reviews), speeches, journals and reference book extracts. 
Text types should also include literary non-fiction texts, such as selections from 
autobiography, letters, obituaries and travel writing. These lists are not exhaustive. 
Texts that are essentially transient, such as instant news feeds and advertisements, will not 
form part of the assessment. 
The Pearson Edexcel International GCSE English Anthology is a resource that supports 
teachers by providing examples of different types of non-fiction text. Students should be 
encouraged to read beyond the anthology to support their learning. 
Students should use what they have learned about different text types to develop their 
transactional writing. They should be introduced to, and be given the opportunity to practise, 
a range of non-fiction writing techniques, planning and proofreading skills.

Assignment taking 
Authenticity 
Students must sign the Non-examined Assessment Authentication Sheet in Appendix 2: 
Non-examined assessment authentication sheet to confirm that they have produced their 
non-examined assessment independently.  
Teachers must also sign the Non-examined Assessment Authentication Sheet to confirm that 
students have been sufficiently supervised to ensure the authenticity of the work.  
Collaboration 
Students must work independently in producing their non-examined assessment.  
Teacher feedback 
• 
Teachers may advise students in the production of non-examined assessment. Teachers 
may suggest general improvements to the non-examined assessment at a draft stage, 
but it is the student’s responsibility to make any corrections and update the work.  
• 
Student work must not be rewritten after it has been marked. 
• 
Students should be informed at the start of the teaching that they must not plagiarise 
other work. Students must acknowledge sources in their work and be advised how to do 
so. Teachers should be alert to essays derived from other sources – such as the internet 
– when signing the declaration on the non-examined assessment front sheet. 
Presentation of the work 
• 
Each piece of non-examined assessment should contain the student’s name, the date on 
which the work was completed, the mark awarded and a brief teacher comment 
justifying the mark. This comment should be based on the assessment criteria for the 
mark range awarded. 
• 
Non-examined assessment pieces may be handwritten or word-processed. 
Word count 
• 
Assignment A: Poetry and Prose Texts  
Students will present a written response of approximately 1200 words. 
• 
Assignment B: Imaginative Writing  
Students will present a written response of approximately 700 words. 
The above word count is advisory only and there is no penalty for exceeding this 
recommendation.

Assignment marking 
Assessment of non-examined component 
Teachers must mark non-examined assessment according to the assessment criteria shown 
on the following pages. Teachers should use their professional judgement to apply the 
criteria appropriately and fairly to the work of students. To help teachers mark accurately, 
consistently and confidently, Pearson offers annual marking training sessions, available 
online. 
Students should be awarded the appropriate mark within any range on a ‘best fit’ basis, 
balancing strengths and weaknesses in each essay. Answers may display characteristics of 
more than one level, and where this happens, markers must use professional judgement to 
decide which level is most appropriate. For example, a passage in the assignment may 
contain characteristics of Level 4 while the rest of the assignment tends towards Level 3. 
The outcome may therefore be a high Level 3.  
Standardisation of non-examined assessment 
To help teachers mark accurately, consistently and confidently, Pearson offers annual 
marking training sessions, available online and presented by our senior examining team. We 
recommend that teachers attend this training in advance of the marking. 
Where there is more than one teacher of the non-examined assessment option in a centre, 
the centre should conduct internal standardisation. This can be carried out by paired 
marking. 
Completed non-examined assessment should be kept secure in the centre until at least six 
months after the examination session. Non-examined assessment may then be returned to 
students. 
Final assessment of non-examined component at the end of the course 
There will be two marks out of 30 which will be combined to make one mark out of 60. At 
the end of the course, the non-examined assessment may be re-assessed and the marks 
adjusted in light of internal standardisation. 
Teachers should reward the quality of the writing and reading demonstrated in the  
non-examined assignment. A second opinion, by a teacher other than the class teacher,  
will enable the centre to arrive at an objective judgement on achievement. 
Submission of non-examined assessment 
Towards the end of the course centres will be required to send a sample of non-examined 
assessment to a Pearson-appointed non-examined assessment moderator. Final  
non-examined assessment marks for each student should be recorded on the non-examined 
assessment front sheet in Appendix 2: Non-examined assessment authentication sheet. 
Teachers should photocopy the number of sheets required. The non-examined assessment 
front sheet should be attached to the front of the non-examined assessment essay. 
Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) document Instructions for 
conducting non-examination assessments for further information.

Additional guidance on the mark scheme: 
Textual reference: any reference to supporting evidence from the text - direct quotations 
or references to specific moments/events within the text, e.g.  
We learn that the recruiting officers in the poem knew the person was under age when he 
joined up: 'Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.'  
We perhaps learn the extent of Madame Loisel's materialistic nature when she disregards the 
many elegant jewels belonging to her friend and selects instead the diamond necklace.  
Citing Disabled, Wilfred Owen and The Necklace, Guy de Maupassant 
Example: citing specific examples of features of language and/or structure from the text, e.g.  
The author uses violent verbs, 'snarled', 'rattled', to convey shock.  
The author structures the poem using a clear pattern of repetition: 'You may shoot me... You 
may cut me… You may kill me...' on lines 21 to 23.

Security and backups 
It is the responsibility of the centre to keep the work that students have submitted for 
assessment secure.  
Secure storage is defined as a securely-locked cabinet or cupboard. The rules on storage 
also apply to electronic data. For materials stored electronically, centres are strongly advised 
to use firewall protection and virus-checking software, and to employ an effective backup 
strategy, so that an up-to-date archive of students’ evidence is maintained.

Spoken Language endorsement (optional) 
The optional spoken language endorsement for Pearson Edexcel 
International GCSE in English Language (Specification A) 
These are the requirements of the optional spoken language endorsement for Pearson 
Edexcel International GCSE in English Language (Specification A) including the recording, 
storing and submission of spoken language assessments. 
The preparation and assessment of spoken language is an optional component of the course 
of study. If a student completes the endorsement, it will appear on their certificate as a 
separately reported grade, alongside the overall grade issued. 
Overview 
Students must demonstrate their presentation skills in a formal setting, listen and respond 
to questions and feedback, and use spoken English effectively. 
Presentation 
The spoken language presentation may take a variety of forms, including: 
a) a speech or talk by a student, followed by questions from the audience 
b) a formal debate or dialogue, such as an interview where the student is able to prepare 
extended responses to questions or prompts, which have been shared in advance, 
followed by questions from the audience. 
In all cases, the presentation should be prepared and last no longer than 10 minutes. 
Audience 
Students must give their presentations to an audience, which must always include the 
teacher. 
The size and composition of the audience should be determined by the teacher, in discussion 
with the student. However, where the audience is the teacher only, the presentation and 
dialogue should be designed in such a way that it could have a potentially wider audience 
than just one person (for example, it replicates a television interview). 
Assessment criteria 
Students should be assessed either live or from recordings. 
There are no marks for the spoken language endorsement. Should students choose to 
attempt the assessment, they should be awarded a grade (Not Classified, Pass, Merit or 
Distinction) using the assessment criteria below. Students’ grades will appear on their 
certificates. 
In order to achieve a particular grade, a student must meet all of the criteria for 
that grade.

5 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our International information manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers 
and is also available on our website. 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications in the same subject, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCSEs/International GCSEs. Students or their advisers who have any 
doubts about subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration 
and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
• 
students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the UK Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
• 
all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English only. All student work must be in 
English. 
We recommend that students have the ability to read and write in English at Level B2 of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Specification – Issue 6 - February 2023 © Pearson Education Limited 2023

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
• 
access the assessment 
• 
show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under 
the UK Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The UK Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable 
adjustments where a student with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps 
to overcome that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular student may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
• 
the needs of the student with the disability 
• 
the effectiveness of the adjustment 
• 
the cost of the adjustment, and 
• 
the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special considerations 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a candidate's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an 
assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for information about how to apply for access arrangements and 
special considerations. 
For information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
considerations please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk

Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered before the candidate has signed 
the declaration of authentication form does not need to be reported to Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after the declaration of authenticity 
has been signed, and in examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ Form MI 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice.  
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or undermines the integrity 
of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a JCQ 
Form M2a (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to: pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
JCQ Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice 
Awarding and reporting 
The International GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale 
from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are 
not graded. The optional spoken language endorsement is graded and certificated Not 
Classified/Pass/Merit or Distinction and appears, when taken, as a separate grade on the 
certificate. The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel International GCSE in 
English Language (Specification A) was in 2018. Students whose level of achievement is 
below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be recorded on a 
certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
Student recruitment and progression  
Pearson’s policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications is that:  
• 
they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard  
• 
they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
• 
equal opportunities exist for all students.

Appendix 4: Pearson World Class Qualification 
design principles 
Pearson’s World Class Qualification design principles mean that all Edexcel qualifications are 
developed to be rigorous, demanding, inclusive and empowering. 
 
We work collaboratively to gain approval from an external panel of educational  
thought-leaders and assessment experts from across the globe. This is to ensure that 
Edexcel qualifications are globally relevant, represent world-class best practice in Pearson 
qualification and assessment design, maintain a consistent standard and support learner 
progression in today’s fast-changing world. 
Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-Class Qualifications is chaired by Sir Michael Barber, a 
leading authority on education systems and reform. He is joined by a wide range of key 
influencers with expertise in education and employability. 
“I’m excited to be in a position to work with the global leaders in curriculum and assessment 
to take a fresh look at what young people need to know and be able to do in the 21st 
century, and to consider how we can give them the opportunity to access that sort of 
education.” Sir Michael Barber.

Endorsement from Pearson’s Expert Panel for World-Class Qualifications for 
International GCSE development processes 
May 2014 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe.  
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous world-class qualification 
development process that has included:  
• 
extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world  
• 
benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand  
• 
establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented, and 
that the design has been guided by Pearson’s Efficacy Framework. This is a structured, 
evidence-based process which means that learner outcomes have been at the heart of this 
development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education but as a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of Pearson Edexcel International GCSE qualifications that are 
outstanding for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded 
as representing world-class best practice.

Appendix 5: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned 
and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and 
can be built upon and extended through learning.’[ 1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework [ 2] as the most evidence-based 
and robust skills framework, and have used this as a basis for our adapted skills framework. 
The framework includes cognitive, intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 
 
 
The skills have been interpreted for this specification to ensure that they are appropriate for 
the subject. All of the skills listed are evident or accessible in the teaching, learning and/or 
assessment of the qualifications. Some skills are directly assessed. Pearson materials will 
support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in students. 
The table overleaf sets out the framework and gives an indication of the skills that can be 
found in English Language and indicates the interpretation of the skill in this area. A full 
subject interpretation of each skill, with mapping to show opportunities for student 
development is given on the subject pages of our website: qualifications.pearson.com

Appendix 6: Glossary 
 
Term 
Definition 
Assessment 
objectives 
The requirements that students need to meet to succeed in the 
qualification. Each assessment objective has a unique focus which is 
then targeted in examinations or coursework/non-examined 
assessment. Assessment objectives may be assessed individually or in 
combination.  
External 
assessment 
An examination that is held at the same time and place in a global 
region.  
JCQ 
Joint Council for Qualifications. This is a group of UK exam boards that 
develops policy related to the administration of examinations.  
Linear 
Qualifications that are linear have all assessments at the end of a 
course of study. It is not possible to take one assessment earlier in the 
course of study. 
NEA 
Non-examined assessment. This is any assessment not sat in 
examination conditions at a fixed time and place. Non-examined 
assessment includes coursework, oral examinations and practical 
examinations. 
Raw marks 
Raw marks are the actual marks that students achieve when taking an 
assessment. When calculating an overall grade, raw marks often need 
to be converted so that it is possible to see the proportionate 
achievement of a student across all units of study.  
UMS 
Uniform Mark Scale. Student’s actual marks (or raw marks) will be 
converted into a UMS mark so that it is possible to see the 
proportionate result of a student. Two units may each be worth 25% of 
a total qualification. The raw marks for each unit may differ, but the 
Uniform Mark will be the same.
