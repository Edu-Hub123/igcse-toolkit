International recognition and acceptance
Our expertise in curriculum, teaching and learning, and assessment is the basis for the recognition of our 
programmes and qualifications around the world. The combination of knowledge and skills in Cambridge 
IGCSE (9–1) Geography gives learners a solid foundation for further study. Candidates who achieve grades 
9 to 4 are well prepared to follow a wide range of courses including Cambridge International AS & A Level 
Geography.
Cambridge IGCSEs are accepted and valued by leading universities and employers around the world as 
evidence of academic achievement. Many universities require a combination of Cambridge International  
AS & A Levels and Cambridge IGCSEs or equivalent to meet their entry requirements.
UK NARIC*, the national agency in the UK for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and 
skills, has carried out an independent benchmarking study of Cambridge IGCSE and found it to be comparable 
to the standard of the GCSE in the UK. This means students can be confident that their Cambridge IGCSE 
qualifications are accepted as equivalent to UK GCSEs by leading universities worldwide.
* Due to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the UK NARIC national recognition agency function was re-titled as UK ENIC 
on 1 March 2021, operated and managed by Ecctis Limited. From 1 March 2021, international benchmarking findings are published 
under the Ecctis name.

3  Subject content 
This syllabus gives you the flexibility to design a course that will interest, challenge and engage your learners. 
Where appropriate you are responsible for selecting topics, subject contexts, resources and examples to 
support your learners’ study. These should be appropriate for the learners’ age, cultural background and 
learning context as well as complying with your school policies and local legal requirements.
The subject content is arranged into the three themes:
	•
Population and settlement
	•
The natural environment 
	•
Economic development.
The content listed is exhaustive except where the word ‘including’ is used. Where ‘including’ is used, 
candidates must study everything in the list but may also study other relevant aspects. For example:
	•
in Topic 2.3, all the coastal landforms you must cover are listed
	•
in Topic 2.5, where ‘including’ is used, you may choose to introduce other climatic characteristics as well as 
the ones listed.
Resources
Some questions in all the written papers are based on resource material, such as photographs, map extracts, 
satellite images, drawings, diagrams, graphs, text extracts, statistics and tables of data. 
To meet the aims of an international syllabus and examination, resource materials come from various areas of 
the world. Candidates may not be familiar with the world areas used in the resources. The questions do not 
require specific regional knowledge. The resources are designed to prompt candidates to use the general 
principles they have studied.
The units used in all resources and papers are:
	•
metres and kilometres for height and distance
	•
degrees centigrade for temperature.
Questions in all papers may include references to latitude or longitude. 
Case studies
Where a case study is specified in a topic, teachers should choose a suitable example to illustrate the subject 
content. For example, Topic 1.6 requires a case study of an urban area. The case study can be from anywhere 
in the world but it must illustrate all the content listed under Topic 1.6. 
You can choose more than one case study for a topic. For example, for Topic 1.6 you could choose Settlement X 
for a case study on land use and Settlement Y for a case study on urban problems.
You can also use the same case study for more than one topic as long as it is suitable for the subject content.

4  Details of the assessment 
Paper 1 – Geographical Themes
Written paper, 1 hour 45 minutes, 75 marks
All candidates take Paper 1. They choose three questions. 
Please note:
Candidates must comply with the instructions for Paper 1. They must choose only three questions, one from 
each of the three sections. Sometimes there is a choice within a question. Candidates must not answer more 
than is required.
Questions are structured with different levels of difficulty. They consist of a combination of resource-based 
tasks and free-response writing requiring place-specific information. 
For resource-based tasks, candidates should interpret and analyse the resource and use the data provided to 
illustrate their understanding of the concept being assessed. 
Candidates are expected to know the location of the continents. 
All the other information they need to answer a resource-based question is in the resource. No other previous 
knowledge is needed of the content of the resource. 
Resources may be:
	•
photographs	
•	
map extracts 
	•
sketch maps	
•	
drawings
	•
diagrams	
•	
graphs
	•
text extracts	
•	
statistics and tables of data-satellite images
	•
GIS data 	
•	
maps showing latitude and longitude
Resource materials are chosen from different world areas. This means that candidates may be dealing with 
world areas they are not familiar with. You should make it clear to candidates that they do not need any 
regional knowledge to answer a resource-based question. Everything they need is provided. It is important that 
candidates are not influenced in their choice of question by the nature or location of a resource.
Case studies
Candidates should refer to suitable case studies to illustrate the individual themes.
You may choose a case study because it relates to:
	•
the local school area
	•
a contemporary development such as the occurrence of a natural hazard in part of the world 
	•
a particular illustration with which you are familiar
	•
a presentation in a newspaper or website or video or film, or a well-documented illustration in a textbook, 
etc.

www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
Back to contents page
A case study may also be based on a field study undertaken as part of the work for Component 3 
(Coursework) or Paper 4 (Alternative to Coursework). Specific questions based on fieldwork will not be set in 
Paper 1, but candidates may use information based on their fieldwork to illustrate answers in Paper 1.
The case studies should give candidates details which they can use in their answers to certain questions on 
Paper 1. Some part questions ask candidates to refer to information from the specific case studies for each 
theme. Candidates may also use details from these case studies to volunteer information when they are 
answering other part questions.
Specific named illustrations of case studies are not included in the syllabus. This is to give you complete 
freedom in selecting examples which you feel are most suitable for your candidates.
Candidates should be aware of the sub-marks for each part question. These are printed on the question paper. 
Candidates should use them as a guide to the amount of detail and length of response expected and to help 
them manage their time effectively.
Paper 2 – Geographical Skills
Written paper, 1 hour 30 minutes, 60 marks.
All candidates take Paper 2. They must answer all the questions. 
The paper tests:
	•
skills of application, interpretation and analysis of geographical information, for example:
–	
topographical maps	
–	
tables of data
–	
other maps	
–	
written material
–	
diagrams	
–	
photographs and pictorial material
–	
graphs
	•
application of graphical and other techniques. 
Candidates do not need any place-specific knowledge to answer questions in Paper 2. Questions that require 
knowledge and understanding (AO1) will be based on topics from the three themes (see section 3).
Equipment for Paper 2
Candidates must have in the examination room:
	•
a pencil, rubber, ruler, protractor and calculator
	•
access to a sheet of plain paper for measuring distance or for assisting with cross-sections on the large-
scale map.
Mapwork question
All answers to the mapwork question must be based on map evidence only.
One question will be based on a large-scale map. The large-scale maps provided will be on a scale of either  
1:25 000 or 1:50 000 and will always contain a full key.

One third of the marks for Paper 2 are for the mapwork question. Candidates are asked to describe and 
analyse a large-scale map. This means that candidates must be proficient in map-reading and interpretation 
skills. 
Candidates should be able to use a co-ordinate reference system and to give and read four-figure and six-figure 
grid references to locate places. 
In this example, the four-figure reference for the dot is 4665 and the six-figure grid reference for the dot is 
463654:

1st Reading (EASTINGS)
2nd Reading
(NORTHINGS)
To give the six-figure grid reference, first identify the grid square, in this case 4665. The third figure is obtained 
by dividing the space between grid lines 46 and 47 into ten equal parts. Similarly, the sixth figure is obtained by 
a division of the gap between northings 65 and 66. This results in a grid reference of 463654 for the dot and 
460650 for the star. Please note that the first tenth is 0 and the last tenth is 9 in the divided grid square.
Candidates should be able to give directions, both in terms of a 16-point compass (such as north, north-north 
east, north east, etc.) and as a bearing from grid north of one place from another. For this reason candidates 
must have protractors in the examination room.
Candidates should be able to measure horizontal distances. This is done most accurately by using a straight-
edged piece of paper and the scale line. If the line to be measured is curved, divide the curve into straight 
sections and rotate the paper after each straight section to follow the next straight section. Finally, place 
the completed straight-edged piece of paper along the linear scale line on the map extract and read off the 
distance in kilometres/metres. This method avoids complicated mathematical calculations which can arise 
when rulers are used.
Candidates should also be able to:
	•
calculate differences in height by means of contour reading
	•
interpret, construct or complete a cross-section
	•
translate the scale of a feature by describing its size and shape in real terms
	•
be proficient in using the key to identify features on the map
	•
draw inferences about the physical and human landscape by interpreting map evidence (including patterns 
of relief, drainage, settlement, communication and land use)
	•
identify basic landscape features (such as river valleys and uplands)
	•
give brief descriptions of basic landscape features using suitable geographical terms (such as ridge, 
plateau, scarp, flood plain) and simple adjectives showing an appreciation of their nature (such as broad, 
flat, steep-sided, deeply cut, gently sloping)
	•
recognise essential differences in density of drainage, stream patterns, gradients or sizes of streams in 
relation to the relief 
Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Geography 0976 syllabus for 2025 and 2026.  Details of the assessment

Back to contents page
	•
describe the physical features of coastlines and the shape and form of river channels as they are shown on 
large-scale maps
	•
describe variations in land use
	•
recognise and analyse patterns of settlement (dispersed, nucleated, linear)
	•
draw sketch maps illustrating these patterns
	•
interpret and describe features of urban morphology as they are shown on large-scale maps
	•
describe the functions of and services provided by settlements
	•
give reasons for the site and growth of individual settlements
	•
recognise communication networks in terms of their type and density in relation to physical and human 
features.
Maps, diagrams, graphs, tables of data, written material
Questions will be set using some or all of these resources, which are all important ways of representing 
geographical data. Resources may be used to illustrate a basic principle which candidates must be able to 
interpret. For example, a population pyramid may be used to illustrate the age and sex structure of a country. 
Maps based on global and other scales may also be used.
Candidates should be able to:
	•
Describe the broad features of the population structure and use the pyramid to identify comparisons and 
contrasts between the male and female populations, the working and non-working population and the  
young-, middle- and old-age groups.
	•
Identify and describe significant features of the human and physical landscape on maps, for example, 
population distribution, population movements, transport networks, settlement layout, relief and drainage.
	•
Recognise patterns and deduce relationships.
	•
Extract specified geographical information from graphs, diagrams, tables of data and written material. 
Various types of graphs, maps and diagrams may be used, for example: pictograms, line graphs, bar 
graphs, divided bar graphs, histograms, kite diagrams, flow diagrams, wind rose graphs, dispersion 
graphs, isoline maps, scatter graphs (including best-fit lines), choropleth maps, pie graphs, triangular 
graphs and radial graphs.
	•
Describe variations and identify trends in information. Graphs may show, for example, temperature, birth 
rate, death rate, energy, rainfall distribution or river discharge.
	•
Plot information on graphs when axes and scales are provided.
Data tables may provide various types of information on physical phenomena, economic activities, population, 
settlement, agricultural and manufacturing output, etc. and candidates may be asked to describe and analyse 
features and trends from the data provided. They may also be asked to suggest a suitable form of graphical 
representation for the data provided.
Written material may be extracts from books, periodicals and newspapers, and candidates will need to show 
an understanding of the material presented.

Photographic and pictorial material (including field sketches)
Questions may include field sketches of physical and human landscapes to stimulate geographical description 
and annotation. Cartoons illustrating a geographical theme may be set for interpretation and analysis.
Some questions will include oblique photographs. Candidates should be able to:
	•
Give simple descriptions of human and physical landscapes (landforms, natural vegetation, land use and 
settlement) and geographical phenomena from photographs, aerial photographs, satellite images and GIS. 
	•
Add specified detail on maps or other material provided to show that they can apply geographical 
knowledge and understanding. 
	•
Use supporting material in conjunction with large-scale maps to identify, describe and analyse features and 
show that they can recognise patterns and deduce trends.
Component 3 – Coursework
Centre-based assessment, 60 marks
Candidates must complete one coursework assignment, set by teachers, of up to 2000 words. 
Coursework assignments may be based on physical geography or human geography or on an interaction 
between physical and human geography. Coursework must be clearly related to one or more of the subject 
themes (see section 3).
The focus of assignments can be common to all candidates at a centre but they do not have to be. There 
should be enough variety and differentiation of tasks, and opportunity for individual initiative in all assignments, 
to fulfil the assessment criteria at all levels of achievement.
Coursework will be assessed on the quality of the content of the assignment in relation to the criteria on 
which assessment is based. The time candidates spend on their coursework assignments should reflect the 
weighting of the component in the total assessment (27.5 per cent). 
Centre-based assessment provides a complementary assessment of the assessment objectives tested in 
Papers 1 and 2, with an emphasis on AO2, skills and analysis. Coursework assignments must cover the 
assessment criteria in the proportions given below.

Where a single hypothesis is stated, it can be broken down into two sub-hypotheses. If the question is not in 
the form of a hypothesis, it is hoped that one or more hypotheses may be derived from any particular one. This 
list is not prescriptive and other titles are equally valid providing they fall within the syllabus.
It is important to note that, although data collection may be a collaborative exercise, a candidate’s actual 
coursework should still be individual in its presentation and analysis. Only part of the total data collected by the 
group may be relevant for a candidate’s particular hypothesis/hypotheses.
Outline proposal forms are no longer in use for this syllabus. As part of teaching, you should give guidance and 
feedback to candidates on whether their coursework title is suitable. 
For guidance on developing suitable titles for coursework go to our School Support Hub

Teacher guidance 
You must devise the coursework assignment and give candidates suitable guidance on their choices and 
methods.
Suitable guidance includes:
	•
introducing the ‘route to geographical enquiry’
	•
outlining the purpose and aims of the assignment
	•
teaching the relevant geographical concepts to allow the assignment to be placed in context 
	•
discussing and giving instructions on data collection methods
	•
introducing suitable presentation techniques
	•
ensuring candidates understand the requirements for the finished assignment, including word counts
	•
ensuring candidates are aware of the extent of individual initiative required to access higher levels in the 
generic mark scheme.
Different candidates will need different levels of individual guidance on their choice of graphs, analytical 
comments or conclusions. You should reflect the amount of guidance provided in the level of marks awarded.
Undertaking coursework assignments
The amount of time candidates spend on their assignment will vary. Assignments should follow a programme 
of introductory work and should assess the outcomes of about four or five weeks’ work in the classroom 
plus homework. You should incorporate coursework assignments into the course at a suitable time.
Candidates are encouraged to use computers to produce coursework for geography, both for word-processed 
text and for computer-generated maps, diagrams and graphs. But you should also remind candidates that 
hand-drawn maps, diagrams and graphs can sometimes be more suitable and more useful than those 
generated by computer.
Candidates will gain credit for selecting and using the most appropriate method for data presentation.

Candidates are set a series of tasks on issues relating to one or more of the subject themes (see section 3). 
Questions test the methodology of questionnaires, observation, counts and measurement techniques, and 
involve testing hypotheses appropriate to specific topics. Questions also test processing, presentation and 
analysis of data.
Candidates should be aware of the general requirements for this paper. To prepare for it they should follow 
the route to geographical enquiry, as for Component 3 (Coursework). They should have some practical 
experience, however limited, of coursework methodology. One approach is to introduce the appropriate 
enquiry skills and techniques relevant to Paper 4 during the teaching of specific topics for Paper 1. For 
example, while you are teaching Topic 2.2 Rivers, you could discuss how key aspects of the form of rivers can 
be measured, how depth data can be plotted and how cross-sectional area and discharge can be calculated. 
You could introduce the skills required for questionnaires, counts and observations in a variety of topics, 
wherever this is practical for the centre. 
Candidates should be aware of the range of aspects involved in the route to geographical enquiry for 
coursework assignments, such as identifying aims and hypotheses, using enquiry skills to collect data, using 
presentation techniques to display data, making analyses of data and reaching conclusions. Enquiry skills 
involved in coursework assignments are stated in items 1 to 7 of ‘The route to geographical enquiry’ in the 
section on Component 3 (Coursework).

Enquiry skills for Paper 4
1	
Formulating aims and hypotheses
Candidates should be familiar with hypotheses as statements that form the basis of coursework 
assignments. The hypotheses may investigate a geographical concept, for example, ‘A CBD has the 
highest concentration of comparison shops.’ Hypotheses can be tested by collecting relevant data, by 
analysis and by drawing conclusions using the data as evidence.
2	
Enquiry skills to collect data 
Questions will test knowledge and application of the methodology used in the following range of enquiry 
skills to collect data.
Questionnaires 
Questionnaires can be oral or written to gain information from an individual or a group of individuals. 
Questionnaires can be used when studying a number of syllabus topics, including: spheres of influence; 
use of services; shopping habits; a farm study; a factory or industrial study; leisure activities; tourism; or 
attitudes of the public to developments associated with resource development. 
Candidates should be aware of:
•	
factors influencing the successful design of questionnaires, for example:
–	
layout
–	
format of questions
–	
appropriate wording of questions
–	
number of questions
•	
the practical considerations involved in conducting a questionnaire, for example:
–	
sampling methods
–	
pilot survey 
–	
location of survey.
Observation 
Examples of using observations to collect data include the recording of land use in an urban area or 
observations of river or coastal features. Candidates can use maps, recording sheets, field sketches and 
annotated photographs to record their observations.
Counts 
Examples of counts are pedestrian and traffic counts. Candidates should be aware of suitable methods 
for recording counts, including the layout of recording sheets, instructions and the information required to 
identify the sheet following the count (time, date, location and name of recorder).
Measurement 
Candidates should be aware that when they are recording measurements, it is important to plan the layout 
of the recording sheet, the location of instruments and the sampling methods used to provide reliable data. 
They should know what measurement equipment is required, such as the quadrat, the clinometer and the 
pebbleometer or callipers. They should be familiar with:
•	
river measurements of channel width, depth, speed of flow and the size and shape of bedload 
•	
beach studies of beach profile, the size and shape of pebbles and the movement of beach material 
•	
weather study instruments closely linked to Theme 2: The natural environment 
•	
measurement techniques associated with human fieldwork such as survey strategies and pedestrian/
traffic counts.

Data presentation techniques
Candidates need to know about the illustrative techniques that can be used to present data. These include 
various types of graphs, maps and diagrams, for example:
•	
line graphs
•	
bar graphs
•	
divided bar graphs
•	
histograms, flow diagrams
•	
wind-rose graphs
•	
isoline maps
•	
scatter graphs (including best-fit lines)
•	
pie graphs
•	
triangular graphs
•	
radial graphs
•	
dispersion graphs
•	
choropleth maps
•	
kite diagrams
•	
pictograms.
4	
Analysis
Candidates should be able to describe the patterns in data presented in graphs and tables of results. 
Questions often require candidates to refer to relevant geographical knowledge and understanding when 
they are interpreting data.
5	
Making conclusions
Using the evidence from the data, candidates should be able to make judgements on the validity of the 
original hypothesis or the aims of the assignment. They must refer to the reliability of the data collected and 
give a critical evaluation of the data collection methods chosen, along with suggestions for other possible 
hypotheses and extension work.

Coursework assessment 
When assessing coursework, you must use the generic mark scheme on the next page. The mark scheme 
allocates marks out of a total of 60.
You should study the generic mark scheme closely at the same time as candidates are preparing topics for 
the coursework assignments. This will help you ensure that topics will provide opportunities for each of the 
assessment criteria at different levels of achievement.
There are two key stages in marking a coursework assignment.
Stage 1:  Use the assessment criteria stated in the generic mark scheme and for each one identify the level of 
achievement (Levels 1–3).
Stage 2:  Then decide which mark within a level of achievement for each assessment criterion best fits the 
standard achieved.
Guidance on using levels-based mark schemes
Marking of the coursework should be positive, rewarding achievement where possible but clearly differentiating 
across the whole range of marks available.
In approaching the assessment process, the marker should look at the work and then make a ‘best fit’ 
judgement as to which level statement it fits.  In practice the work does not always match one level statement 
precisely so a judgement may need to be made between two or more level statements.
Once a ‘best fit’ level statement has been identified, the following guide should be used to decide on a specific 
mark:
	•
Where the candidate’s work convincingly meets the level statement, the highest mark should be awarded.
	•
Where the candidate’s work adequately meets the level statement, the most appropriate mark in the 
middle of the range should be awarded.
	•
Where the candidate’s work just meets the level statement, the lowest mark should be awarded.

Coursework guidance notes
Recording and submitting candidates’ marks and work
Please refer to the samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples for information, dates 
and methods of submission of candidates’ marks and work.
You should record candidates’ marks for Component 3 Coursework on the Individual 
Candidate Record Card which you should download each year from the samples database at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples. The database will ask you for your country/territory and the 
syllabus code (i.e. 0976), after which it will take you to the correct forms. Follow the instructions on the form to 
complete it.
The marks on this form must be identical to the marks you submit to Cambridge International.
Internal moderation
If more than one teacher in your centre is marking internal assessments, you must make arrangements 
to moderate or standardise your teachers’ marking so that all candidates are assessed to a common 
standard. (If only one teacher is marking internal assessments, no internal moderation is necessary.) 
You can find further information on the process of internal moderation on the samples database at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples
You should record the internally moderated marks for all candidates on the Coursework Assessment 
Summary Form and submit these marks to Cambridge International according to the instructions set out in the 
Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of assessment.
External moderation
Cambridge International will externally moderate all internally assessed components.
	•
You must submit the marks of all candidates to Cambridge International.
	•
You must also submit the marked work of a sample of candidates to Cambridge International. 
The sample you submit to Cambridge International should include examples of the marking of each teacher. 
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples explains how the sample will be 
selected.
The samples database also provides details of how to submit the marks and work. 
External moderators will produce a short report for each centre with feedback on your marking and 
administration of the assessment.

Supervising coursework 
A general discussion on the progress of coursework is a natural part of the teacher–candidate relationship, as 
it is for other parts of the course. If plans and first drafts are completed under teacher supervision, you can be 
sure of the authenticity of the final coursework. Candidates can draft and redraft work, but you should only give 
brief summative comments on progress during this drafting phase.
Coursework must be a candidate’s own, unaided work. Unless there is subject-specific guidance that says 
otherwise, you can support candidates by reviewing their work before it is handed in for final assessment. 
You can do this orally or through written feedback. Your advice should be kept at a general level so that the 
candidate leads the discussion and makes the suggestions for any amendments. You must not give detailed 
advice to individual candidates or groups of candidates on how their work can be improved to meet the 
assessment criteria. You should not correct or edit draft coursework.
For further information about supervising coursework, see the Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of 
assessment at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
Authenticity and academic honesty 
It is the centre’s responsibility to make sure all assessed work is the candidate’s original work. Candidates must 
not submit someone else’s work as their own, or use material produced by someone else without citing and 
referencing it properly. You should make candidates aware of the academic conventions governing quotation 
and reference to the work of others, and teach candidates how to use them. 
A candidate taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as his or her own is an example of 
plagiarism. It is your responsibility as a teacher to prevent plagiarism from happening and to detect it if it does 
happen. For more information, search for ‘Preventing plagiarism – guidance for teachers’ on our website at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/teachingandassessment

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as 
administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to an administrative zone determined by their location. 
Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An 
entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone 
and the available assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the 
support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all 
other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes and carry forward marks
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes 
Candidates cannot resubmit, in whole or in part, coursework from a previous series. To confirm if an option 
is available to carry forward marks for this syllabus, refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries for the 
relevant series. Regulations for carrying forward internally assessed marks can be found in the Cambridge 
Handbook for the relevant year at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Language
This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only. 
Accessibility and equality
Syllabus and assessment design 
Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination. We develop and design syllabuses and 
assessment materials to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and 
candidates with protected characteristics; these protected characteristics include special educational needs 
and disability, religion and belief, and characteristics related to gender and identity. In addition, the language 
and layout used are designed to make our materials as accessible as possible. This gives all candidates the 
fairest possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the 
requirement to make reasonable adjustments during the assessment process.

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International 
complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for 
candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise 
be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we 
may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by 
minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and 
understanding in an assessment. 
Important: 
	•
Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment 
and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes 
a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and 
integrity of the assessment. 
	•
Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our 
standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not 
included in the list of standard access arrangements. 
	•
Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts they have completed.
After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the 
standard required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).

How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
1	
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and 
skills specified in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
2	
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which 
students are more likely to be successful. 
	
The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Geography will be published after the first assessment of the 
syllabus in 2025.
