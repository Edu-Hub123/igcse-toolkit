International recognition and acceptance
Our expertise in curriculum, teaching and learning, and assessment is the basis for the recognition of our 
programmes and qualifications around the world. The combination of knowledge and skills in Cambridge 
IGCSE (9–1) Mathematics gives learners a solid foundation for further study. Candidates who achieve grades 
9 to 4 are well prepared to follow a wide range of courses including Cambridge International AS & A Level 
Mathematics.
Cambridge IGCSEs are accepted and valued by leading universities and employers around the world as 
evidence of academic achievement. Many universities require a combination of Cambridge International AS & A 
Levels and Cambridge IGCSEs or equivalent to meet their entry requirements.
UK NARIC*, the national agency in the UK for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and 
skills, has carried out an independent benchmarking study of Cambridge IGCSE and found it to be comparable 
to the standard of the GCSE in the UK. This means students can be confident that their Cambridge IGCSE 
qualifications are accepted as equivalent to UK GCSEs by leading universities worldwide.
* Due to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the UK NARIC national recognition agency function was re-titled as UK ENIC 
on 1 March 2021, operated and managed by Ecctis Limited. From 1 March 2021, international benchmarking findings are published 
under the Ecctis name.

Mathematical conventions
Mathematics is a universal language where there are some similarities and differences around the world. The 
guidance below outlines the conventions used in Cambridge examinations and we encourage candidates to 
follow these conventions.
Working with graphs
	•
A plot of a graph should have points clearly marked, for example as small crosses (×), and must: 
–	
be drawn on graph or squared paper 
–	
cover a given range of values by calculating the coordinates of points and connecting them 
appropriately (where values are given, it will include enough points to determine a curve; where a table 
of values is not provided, the candidate must decide on the appropriate number of points required to 
determine the curve)
–	
have each point plotted to an accuracy of within half of the smallest square on the grid. 
	•
A sketch of a graph does not have to be accurate or to scale, nor does it need to be on graph or squared 
paper, but it must:
–	
be drawn freehand
–	
show the most important features, e.g. x-intercepts, y-intercepts, turning points, symmetry, with 
coordinates or values marked on the axes, where appropriate
–	
have labelled axes, e.g. with x and y
–	
interact with the axes appropriately, e.g. by intersecting or by tending towards
–	
fall within the correct quadrants
–	
show the correct long-term behaviour.
	•
Graphs should extend as far as possible across any given grid, within any constraints of the domain.
	•
Where graphs of functions are:
–	
linear, they should be ruled
–	
non-linear, the points should be joined with a smooth curve.
	•
A tangent to a curve should touch the curve at the required point and be in contact with the curve for the 
minimum possible distance. It should not cross the curve at the point where it is a tangent.
	•
Values should be read off a graph to an accuracy of within half of the smallest square on the grid. 
Communicating mathematically
	•
If candidates are asked to show their working, they cannot gain full marks without clearly communicating 
their method, even if their final answer is correct. 
	•
A numerical answer should not be given as a combination of fractions and decimals, e.g. .0 2
1  is not 
acceptable. 
Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Mathematics 0980 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027.  Details of the assessment 
63
www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
Back to contents page
Accuracy
	•
Answers are expected to be given in their simplest form unless the question states otherwise.
	•
Where a question asks for ‘exact values’ the answer may need to be given in terms of π or in surd form, 
depending on the question.
	•
Where answers are not exact values, they should be given to three significant figures unless a different 
accuracy is defined in the question. 
	•
Answers that are exact to four or five significant figures should not be rounded unless the question states 
otherwise.
	•
In order to obtain an answer correct to an appropriate degree of accuracy, a higher degree of accuracy will 
often be needed within the working.
	•
If a question asks to prove or show a given answer to a specified degree of accuracy, candidates must 
show full working, intermediate answers and the final answer to at least one degree of accuracy more than 
that asked for.

5  What else you need to know 
This section is an overview of other information you need to know about this syllabus. It will help to share the 
administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more 
information about our administrative processes at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Before you start
Previous study
We recommend that learners starting this course should have studied a mathematics curriculum such as the 
Cambridge Lower Secondary programme or equivalent national educational framework.
Guided learning hours
We design Cambridge IGCSE syllabuses to require about 130 guided learning hours for each subject. This is 
for guidance only. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the qualification may vary according to each 
school and the learners’ previous experience of the subject.
Availability and timetables 
All Cambridge schools are allocated to one of six administrative zones. Each zone has a specific timetable. 
You can view the timetable for your administrative zone at www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables
You can enter candidates in the June and November exam series. 
Check you are using the syllabus for the year the candidate is taking the exam. 
Private candidates can enter for this syllabus. For more information, please refer to the Cambridge Guide to 
Making Entries. 
Combining with other syllabuses
Candidates can take this syllabus alongside other Cambridge International syllabuses in a single exam series. 
The only exceptions are:
	•
Cambridge IGCSE Mathematics (0580)
	•
Cambridge IGCSE International Mathematics (0607)
	•
Cambridge O Level Mathematics (4024)
	•
syllabuses with the same title at the same level.
Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) and Cambridge O Level syllabuses are at the same level.
Group awards: Cambridge ICE 
Cambridge ICE (International Certificate of Education) is a group award for Cambridge IGCSE. It allows schools 
to offer a broad and balanced curriculum by recognising the achievements of learners who pass exams in a 
range of different subjects.

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as 
administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to an administrative zone determined by their location. 
Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An 
entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone 
and the available assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the 
support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all 
other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes 
Language
This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only. 
Accessibility and equality
Syllabus and assessment design 
Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination. We develop and design syllabuses and 
assessment materials to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and 
candidates with protected characteristics; these protected characteristics include special educational needs 
and disability, religion and belief, and characteristics related to gender and identity. In addition, the language 
and layout used are designed to make our materials as accessible as possible. This gives all candidates the 
fairest possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the 
requirement to make reasonable adjustments during the assessment process.
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International 
complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for 
candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise 
be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we 
may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by 
minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and 
understanding in an assessment.

67
www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
Back to contents page
Important: 
	•
Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment 
and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes 
a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and 
integrity of the assessment. 
	•
Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our 
standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not 
included in the list of standard access arrangements. 
	•
Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts they have completed.
After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the 
standard required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
1	
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and 
skills specified in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
2	
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which 
students are more likely to be successful. 
	
The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Mathematics will be published after the first assessment of the 
syllabus in 2025.
