Internal moderation
If more than one teacher in your centre is marking internal assessments, you must make arrangements 
to moderate or standardise your teachers’ marking so that all candidates are assessed to a common 
standard. (If only one teacher is marking internal assessments, no internal moderation is necessary.) 
You can find further information on the process of internal moderation on the samples database 
at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples
You should record the internally moderated marks for all candidates on the Coursework Assessment 
Summary Form and submit these marks to Cambridge International according to the instructions set out in the 
Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of assessment.
External moderation
Cambridge International will externally moderate all internally assessed components.
	•
You must submit the marks of all candidates to Cambridge International.
	•
You must also submit the marked work of a sample of candidates to Cambridge International. 
The sample you submit to Cambridge International should ideally include examples of the marking of each 
teacher. The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples explains how the sample will 
be selected.
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples also provides details of how to submit 
the marks and work. 
External moderators will produce a short report for each centre with feedback on your marking and 
administration of the assessment.

Additional information for Component 3 Coursework Portfolio
Please read this information in conjunction with the relevant sections of the Cambridge Handbook for the 
relevant year of assessment.
Assignments: general issues
	•
Assignments should arise from the programme of study undertaken by the teaching group. 
	•
The best assignments are usually those that come from a shared learning experience but are finally chosen 
by individual candidates; negotiation of assignments with the teacher is recommended.
	•
All tasks set should be sufficiently challenging to stretch candidates to their full potential. For example, a 
class might study types of short story and their structures and conventions before individual candidates 
choose their own titles and write their own short stories for Assignment 3. 
	•
Questions from past examination papers should not be used for coursework. 
	•
Candidates are not expected to work under timed conditions. 
	•
Assignments 1–3 may be completed in any sequence during the course. It is generally better that 
candidates complete more than three assignments during the course from which a suitable choice can 
eventually be made for the final portfolio.
	•
The assignments must clearly demonstrate different writing intentions and styles to the reader.
Assignment 1
	•
Assignment 1 is a piece of directed writing in response to a text or texts chosen by the teacher (or by the 
candidate, with the teacher’s approval). 
	•
This assignment is assessed for both writing and reading skills.
	•
Centres are advised to select text(s) of approximately two sides of A4 in total. Text(s) may consist of facts, 
opinions and/or arguments which can be selected, analysed and evaluated by the candidate and can be 
integrated into their own views. 
	•
Note that literature texts are not usually suitable for this assignment. 
	•
Text(s) may be of local, national or global interest – or all three – and should be suitable for the ability range 
of the candidates. They may be drawn from a variety of sources, e.g. newspapers, magazine articles, travel 
writing, text-based websites and media. 
	•
Note that text(s) that are mainly informative or that provide content which has no development/discussion 
should not be set. 
	•
Candidates should be able to give an overview of the argument as a whole and illustrate their 
understanding by commenting on specific ideas presented by the author of the text. This should include 
an explanation of any ideas of interest and an argument for or against them, as well as examining them for 
inconsistencies and substituting complementary or opposing views (e.g. recognise and comment on bias). 
	•
The assignment may be written in any appropriate form, e.g. an article, a letter, or the words of a speech. 
	•
A copy of all texts used for Assignment 1 must be included with the sample of portfolios sent to the 
external moderator.

Back to contents page
Assignment 1
Discuss/argue and/or 
persuade in response to 
text(s)
Two examples:
	•
You are a local resident and feel very strongly about the ideas 
suggested in your local newspaper. Write a response to the editor 
in which you argue for or against the proposed ideas. 
	
In your discussion you will need to evaluate the ideas and opinions 
presented in the text and centre your arguments around what is said.   
Text: a letter or article from a local newspaper arguing in favour of or 
against a controversial local issue. For example: plans to make changes 
to the local transport system, proposals to build a community building on 
public land or a plan to address the behaviour of young people in the area.
Note to teachers: responses could be in any appropriate form, e.g. a letter 
or an article. 
	•
You have read the transcript of a speech by a well-known person 
about an important topical issue. Write a response to that person 
in which you try to persuade them to change their minds about 
what they have said. 
In your discussion you will need to evaluate the ideas and opinions 
presented in the speech and centre your arguments around what they 
have said.
Text: a speech about a current topical, local or global issue. For example: 
a teacher’s speech about space travel, a celebrity’s speech about an 
environmental issue, or a doctor’s speech about medicine.
Note to teachers: responses could be in any appropriate form, e.g. a 
speech or a letter.
Assignment 2
	•
Assignment 2 is a piece of descriptive writing which is assessed for writing skills only.
	•
Candidates may submit poetry for Assignment 2, but this must be accompanied by some form of 
commentary by the candidate, e.g. about how the poem(s) came to be written. The commentary will be 
included in the word count.
	•
The candidate should develop ideas and images which create a convincing, well-defined picture, with 
varieties of focus. 
Assignment 2
Writing to describe
Two examples:
	•
You are in a busy place waiting for a friend who is late. Describe 
your surroundings and your thoughts and feelings as you wait. 
Note to teachers: a busy place can be any place which provides a definite 
sense of place/atmosphere and will contain a range of sights, sounds and/
or characters for candidates to describe, e.g. cafes, train or bus stations, 
airport arrival or departure areas, sports stadiums, beaches and markets. 
	•
Describe an important gathering or celebration. 
Note to teachers: candidates should be encouraged to choose a 
celebration or gathering of which they have personal experience. 
Appropriate occasions could be any event which provides a definite 
sense of place/atmosphere and will contain a range of sights, sounds 
and/or characters for candidates to describe, e.g. weddings, significant 
anniversaries or birthdays.

Assignment 3
	•
Assignment 3 is a piece of narrative writing which is assessed for writing skills only.
	•
Candidates may write in any form. 
	•
The candidate should ensure the plot is well defined and developed with features of fiction writing, such as 
description, characterisation and convincing details. 
Assignment 3
Writing to narrate
Two examples:
	•
Write a narrative piece in which the following words appear ‘and 
then they finally realised that it didn’t really matter anymore’.
Note to teachers: the words may appear in any part of the narrative writing. 
Candidates may write in a range of appropriate narrative forms, e.g. the 
opening or closing chapter of a novel or a short story. 
	•
Write a fictional or autobiographical account of an important or 
life-changing event. 
Note to teachers: candidates may write in a range of appropriate narrative 
forms and perspectives, e.g. a short story or several diary entries.
Marking of work should be positive, rewarding achievement where possible, but clearly differentiating across 
the whole range of marks, where appropriate.
The marker should look at the work and then make a judgement about which level statement is the best fit. 
In practice, work does not always match one level statement precisely so a judgement may need to be made 
between two or more level statements.
Once a best-fit level statement has been identified, use the following guidance to decide on a specific mark:
	•
If the candidate’s work convincingly meets the level statement, award the highest mark.
	•
If the candidate’s work adequately meets the level statement, award the most appropriate mark in the 
middle of the range (where middle marks are available).
	•
If the candidate’s work just meets the level statement, award the lowest mark.

Component 4 Speaking and Listening Test
Individual Talk and Conversation, approximately 10–12 minutes in total, 40 marks 
This component is separately endorsed with grades of 1 (high) to 5 (low). Marks for Component 4 do not 
contribute to a candidate’s overall grade. 
Teachers must treat this component as a non-coursework speaking test and must read this information in 
conjunction with the relevant sections of the Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of assessment.  
There are two parts to the Speaking and Listening Test. In Part 1, candidates present an individual talk. In Part 2, 
candidates engage in a conversation with the teacher/examiner on their chosen topic. 
There is no question paper for the test. The test must be taken within the Speaking and Listening Test window. 
You should record all candidates. Candidates must only take the Speaking and Listening Test once and both 
parts of the test must be recorded as one.
Part 1 Individual Talk (3–4 minutes) (20 marks) 
The candidate talks for about 3–4 minutes on a single topic or theme which they have selected before the test. 
The candidate talks about a topic of particular interest, for example, about the candidate’s reactions to meeting 
a famous person or about a recent film, which would include suggestions as to why others would also like it.
Candidates need to show that they are able to prepare and organise material, are aware of audience, and can 
select and employ a range of language devices. Candidates are encouraged to make presentations which are 
lively, by perhaps incorporating more creative presentational styles, such as taking up a ‘voice’ or presenting a 
dramatic monologue. 
There is no question paper and each candidate chooses their own subject with guidance from their teacher. 
Teachers should advise on the suitability of topics or themes, but must not be involved in the preparation of 
material for the Individual Talk. The interaction is between the candidate and the teacher only, although the 
class may be present as an audience.
Candidates may bring one ‘cue card’ (about postcard size) into the examination room, to remind them of the 
main points they wish to make. The cue card should contain a list of key points, not continuous sentences. 
Candidates may write their points on one side of the cue card only. Candidates may also use a limited quantity 
of illustrative material, which may include maps, diagrams, statistics and pictures. Reading from, or reliance on, 
a script or extended notes is not allowed. Recitation of a memorised script is unlikely to be successful. The cue 
card and illustrative material must be retained by centres until six months after publication of results. The cue 
card and illustrative material must be labelled with the candidate’s name and number. 
The talk should be continuous. If absolutely necessary the teacher/examiner may prompt a candidate who is 
finding it difficult to continue within the advised time of 3–4 minutes. Teachers/examiners should interrupt to ask 
questions, and begin Part 2, if the candidate shows no sign of finishing after 4½ minutes.
Dictionaries may be used to prepare the Individual Talk, but they may not be taken into the test.
This part of the test is to be assessed using the level descriptions in Table A on page 25. 
The Individual Talk tests the following speaking and listening assessment objectives (20 marks): 
SL1 articulate experience and express what is thought, felt and imagined 
SL2 present facts, ideas and opinions in a cohesive order which sustains the audience’s interest 
SL3 communicate clearly and purposefully using fluent language 
SL4 use register appropriate to context.

26
www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
Back to contents page
Part 2 Conversation (7–8 minutes) (20 marks) 
The Individual Talk leads into a conversation with the teacher/examiner about the candidate’s chosen topic. For 
example, an account of meeting a famous person could be developed into a discussion of wider issues such 
as the nature and role of ‘celebrity’ and media intrusion; a talk about a film could be developed into discussion 
of wider issues such as censorship, popular culture and the film industry.
Candidates should be encouraged to consider how a conversation might develop around their chosen topic; if 
they cannot think of six questions they could be asked, the topic is unlikely to be easy to discuss. 
During the Individual Talk, teachers/examiners are likely to make notes in order to help them ask appropriate 
questions. 
Candidates must be prepared to supply additional factual material where appropriate and to express and 
defend a point of view. In order to give the candidate every opportunity, questions should be open, such as 
‘tell me more about...’, ‘why?’ and ‘how?’, rather than closed questions which may be answered by ‘yes/no’. 
Candidates should not be made to feel embarrassed about expressing viewpoints that are not those of the 
teacher/examiner. The teacher/examiner may wish to ask questions about those views, but these questions 
must not be judgemental. 
The teacher/examiner should normally allow 7–8 minutes for each candidate. If a candidate ‘dries up’ after a 
few minutes, teachers/examiners should be ready to explore another aspect of the topic or theme; they should 
keep trying to make conversation so that the candidate is given every opportunity to demonstrate their ability. 
Questions should be rephrased (rather than repeated) in an attempt to continue the dialogue. 
Teachers/examiners should beware of talking too much and of candidates being given credit for what the 
teacher/examiner has actually said. Candidates are responsible for showing that they can converse adequately; 
at the same time the teacher/examiner must make sure the candidate is given every opportunity to converse by 
following up any opening given.
Dictionaries may not be used in the test.
This part of the test is to be assessed using the level descriptions in Table B on pages 26 and 27.
The Conversation tests the following speaking and listening assessment objectives (20 marks): 
SL1 articulate experience and express what is thought, felt and imagined 
SL2 present facts, ideas and opinions in a cohesive order which sustains the audience’s interest 
SL3 communicate clearly and purposefully using fluent language 
SL4 use register appropriate to context
SL5 listen and respond appropriately in conversation. 
Marking instructions 
The teacher must mark each candidate’s test out of a total of 40, in line with the level descriptions. The total 
mark for the test is divided into 20 marks for Speaking in Part 1 (Individual Talk), and 10 marks for Speaking 
and 10 marks for Listening in Part 2 (Conversation).

Marking: general principles 
Marking of the Speaking and Listening Test should be positive, rewarding achievement where possible, but 
clearly differentiating across the whole range of marks, where appropriate.
The marker should look at the work and then make a judgement about which level statement is the best fit. 
In practice, work does not always match one level statement precisely so a judgement may need to be made 
between two or more level statements.
Once a best-fit level statement has been identified, use the following guidance to decide on a specific mark:
	•
If the candidate’s work convincingly meets the level statement, award the highest mark.
	•
If the candidate’s work adequately meets the level statement, award the most appropriate mark in the 
middle of the range (where middle marks are available).
	•
If the candidate’s work just meets the level statement, award the lowest mark.

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as 
administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their 
location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment 
options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the 
administrative zone and the available assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the 
support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all 
other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide

Accessibility and equality
Syllabus and assessment design 
Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination in our syllabuses and assessment 
materials. We aim to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and with 
other protected characteristics. In addition, the language and layout used are designed to make our materials 
as accessible as possible. This gives all learners the opportunity, as fairly as possible, to demonstrate their 
knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the requirement to make reasonable adjustments 
during the assessment process.
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International 
complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for 
candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise 
be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we 
may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by 
minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and 
understanding in an assessment. 
Important: 
	•
Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment 
and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with The Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes 
a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and 
integrity of the assessment. 
	•
Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our 
standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in The Cambridge Handbook 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
	•
Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not 
included in the list of standard access arrangements. 
	•
Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts they have completed. 
Some access arrangements are not allowed in this syllabus because they affect the assessment objective: 
	•
candidates are not allowed to use voice-activated software to dictate their written work 
	•
human readers are not allowed. 
If your candidate(s) will have significant difficulties accessing the components of this qualification, please 
contact info@cambridgeinternational.org before starting the course.

After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the 
standard required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate.  
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
	•
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment:
–	
confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified 
in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
	•
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes:
–	
help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students 
are more likely to be successful
–	
help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) First Language Engish will be published after the first 
assessment of the syllabus in 2020. Find more information at www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcse
