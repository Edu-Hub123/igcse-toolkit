Our expertise in curriculum, teaching and learning, and assessment is the basis for the recognition of our 
programmes and qualifications around the world. The combination of knowledge and skills in Cambridge IGCSE 
(9–1) Literature in English gives learners a solid foundation for further study. Candidates who achieve grades 9 to 4

Requirements: set texts in open-book examinations
Candidates are not able to take into open-book examinations set texts that include notes, highlighting or 
underlining. Check Section 4 Details of the assessment for further information.
Resources: set text editions for classroom use
There are many editions of set texts available, with newer editions sometimes including notes (often displayed on 
facing pages), illustrations, activities and further resources which make these texts particularly useful and user-
friendly for classroom use.
The edition of Shakespeare used for setting extract questions on examination papers is the Alexander Text of The 
Complete Works of William Shakespeare, ed. Peter Alexander (Collins, 1951; new edition 2006, introduced by Peter 
Ackroyd). However, this complete, standard one-volume edition is not recommended for classroom study of 
individual plays.
Although we do not specify editions of individual plays, here are some examples of reliable and useful series:
	•
Cambridge School Shakespeare series 	
edited R Gibson, V Wienand and R Andrews
	•
Cambridge Literature series	
edited J Baxter
	•
Penguin Shakespeare 	
Penguin 
	•
Oxford School Shakespeare

Coursework guidance notes
The following notes provide general guidance that teachers should give candidates on creating and presenting the 
coursework portfolio, as well as guidance on marking and internal moderation.
For more detailed information, please refer to the Cambridge Handbook for the relevant year of assessment and 
samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples
Format
	•
The coursework portfolio must contain two assignments, each on a different text.
	•
Assignments should be between 600 and 1200 words (including quotations, but excluding references and 
bibliography). Candidates may disadvantage themselves if their assignments are significantly over or under the 
word count guidance.
	•
Assignments can be written electronically or by hand.
	•
The assignments must be securely fastened and clearly marked with the candidate’s name, number and the 
centre number. Do not send the assignments in folders, plastic wallets or ringbinders.
	•
Each portfolio must include a completed Individual Candidate Record Card. 
	•
The centre’s sample must include a completed Coursework Assessment Summary Form.
General
	•
Candidates can complete their assignments at any time during the course, usually following a programme of 
study undertaken by a teaching group. Candidates should undertake more than two assignments so that they 
have a choice of assignments to include in their portfolio. Although assignments are selected by the candidate, 
it is recommended that the teacher and candidate discuss which are the best assignments to submit.
	•
Candidates should remember to proofread their work carefully.
Texts
	•
Assignment texts can be chosen by teachers or by candidates and teachers together. The texts must have been 
originally written in English, and must be of a quality appropriate for study at Cambridge IGCSE.
	•
Candidates within a centre do not have to submit assignments on the same texts.
	•
Assignments must show that the candidate has studied the whole text.
	•
If poetry or short stories are used for an assignment, candidates must cover a minimum of two poems or 
stories. Candidates are not required to compare poems or stories within the assignment, as it is assumed that 
the assignment is based on the study of a wider selection of poems or stories broadly equivalent to a poetry or 
short stories set text.
Recording and submitting candidates’ marks and work 
Please refer to the samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples for information, dates and 
methods of submission of candidates’ marks and work.
You should record candidates’ marks for Component 5 Coursework on the Individual Candidate Record Card and 
the Coursework Assessment Summary Form, which you should download each year from the samples database at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples. The database will ask you for the syllabus code (i.e. 0992), after which 
it will take you to the correct forms. Follow the instructions on the form to complete it.
The marks on these forms must be identical to the marks you submit to Cambridge International.

Back to contents page
Marking
Teachers must mark each assignment out of a total of 25, in accordance with the assessment criteria. Marking 
involves balancing the strengths and weaknesses in the candidate’s work. If a candidate submits no assignment, a 
mark of zero must be recorded.
Internal moderation 
If more than one teacher in your centre is marking internal assessments, you must make arrangements to moderate 
or standardise your teachers’ marking so that all candidates are assessed to a common standard. (If only one 
teacher is marking internal assessments, no internal moderation is necessary.) You can find further information on 
the process of internal moderation on the samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples
You should record the internally moderated marks for all candidates on the Coursework Assessment Summary 
Form and submit these marks to Cambridge International according to the instructions set out in the Cambridge 
Handbook for the relevant year of assessment.
External moderation 
Cambridge International will externally moderate all internally assessed components.
	•
You must submit the marks of all candidates to Cambridge International.
	•
You must also submit the marked work of a sample of candidates to Cambridge International. 
	•
The sample you submit to Cambridge International should include examples of the marking of each teacher. 
The samples database at www.cambridgeinternational.org/samples explains how the sample will be selected. 
	•
The samples database also provides details of how to submit the marks and work. 
External moderators will produce a short report for each centre with feedback on your marking and administration 
of the assessment.
Authenticity and avoidance of plagiarism
It is the centre’s responsibility to make sure all assessed work is the candidate’s original work. If plans and first 
drafts are completed under teacher supervision, you can be sure of the authenticity of the final coursework. You 
should not correct or edit draft coursework. Candidates can draft and redraft work, but you should only give brief 
summative comments on progress during this drafting phase. A general discussion on the progress of coursework is 
a natural part of the teacher–candidate relationship, as it is for other parts of the course.
Candidates must understand that they cannot submit someone else’s work as their own, or use material produced 
by someone else without citing and referencing it properly. You should make candidates aware of the academic 
conventions governing quotation and reference to the work of others, and teach candidates how to use them. 
This should include full reference to the publication, including date, author and page number. If it is a website, the 
website address and the date the website was accessed should be included.
Candidates must not use online tools which act as writing assistants in the production of their coursework. Online 
writing assistant tools identify specific sections of the candidate’s work where a correction should be made and 
propose specific words that should be used instead.
A candidate taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as his or her own is an example of 
plagiarism. It is your responsibility as a teacher to prevent plagiarism from happening and to detect it if it does 
happen. For more information, search for ‘Preventing plagiarism – guidance for teachers’ on our website at

Guidance on using levels-based mark schemes 
Marking of work should be positive, rewarding achievement where possible, but clearly differentiating across the 
whole range of marks, where appropriate.
The marker should look at the work and then make a judgement about which level statement is the best fit. In 
practice, work does not always match one level statement precisely so a judgement may need to be made between 
two or more level statements.
Once a best-fit level statement has been identified, use the following guidance to decide on a specific mark:
	•
If the candidate’s work convincingly meets the level statement, award the highest mark.
	•
If the candidate’s work adequately meets the level statement, award the most appropriate mark in the middle 
of the range (where middle marks are available).
	•
If the candidate’s work just meets the level statement, award the lowest mark.

Making entries
Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work 
closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus 
components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making 
Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.
Exam administration
To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative 
zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has 
a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code 
is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available 
assessment options.
Support for exams officers
We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support 
they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases 
of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
Retakes and carrying forward marks
Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at 
www.cambridgeinternational.org/entries 
Candidates cannot resubmit, in whole or in part, coursework from a previous series. To confirm if an option is 
available to carry forward marks for this syllabus, refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries for the relevant 
series. Regulations for carrying forward internally assessed marks can be found in the Cambridge Handbook for the 
relevant year at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
Equality and inclusion
We have taken great care to avoid bias of any kind in the preparation of this syllabus and related assessment 
materials. In our effort to comply with the UK Equality Act (2010) we have taken all reasonable steps to avoid any 
direct and indirect discrimination.
The standard assessment arrangements may present barriers for candidates with impairments. Where a candidate 
is eligible, we may be able to make arrangements to enable that candidate to access assessments and receive 
recognition of their attainment. We do not agree access arrangements if they give candidates an unfair advantage 
over others or if they compromise the standards being assessed.
Candidates who cannot access the assessment of any component may be able to receive an award based on the 
parts of the assessment they have completed.
Information on access arrangements is in the Cambridge Handbook at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 
Language

After the exam
Grading and reporting
Grades 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE (9–1). 
9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard 
required for grade 1. ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. 
In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:
	•
Q (PENDING)
	•
X (NO RESULT).
These letters do not appear on the certificate.
On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL 
CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).
How students and teachers can use the grades
Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:
	•
to measure learning and achievement
	
The assessment:
–	
confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in 
the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
	•
to show likely future success
	
The outcomes:
–	
help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are 
more likely to be successful
–	
help students choose the most suitable course or career.
Grade descriptions
Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded 
particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better 
performance in some other aspect.
Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE (9–1) Literature in English will be published after the first assessment of 
the syllabus in 2020. Find more information at www.cambridgeinternational.org/0992
